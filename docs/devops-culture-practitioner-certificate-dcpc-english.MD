1) What are your observations on Security Engineers and Scrum Team's dynamic in Sprint Two of the simulation? Select all that apply.
A. Security Engineer introduces formal security scan prior to scheduled release.
B. Security Engineer collaborates with Scrum Team from the start of the sprint.
C. All security bugs are properly logged into a bug tracking system.
D. Security becomes "the whole team's concern".

Based on the given options, here are the observations that seem relevant to the dynamic between Security Engineers and the Scrum Team during Sprint Two:
A. Security Engineer introduces formal security scan prior to scheduled release.
    This suggests a proactive approach by the Security Engineer to ensure security before the release, which could be a positive practice for improving product security.
B. Security Engineer collaborates with Scrum Team from the start of the sprint.
    Ideally, security should be integrated early in the sprint, meaning the Security Engineer’s collaboration from the start ensures security is embedded in the development process rather than being an afterthought.
C. All security bugs are properly logged into a bug tracking system.
    This is an essential aspect of maintaining a well-organized workflow. Logging security bugs in a tracking system ensures they are addressed and monitored throughout the development process.
D. Security becomes "the whole team's concern".
    This indicates that security is not solely the responsibility of the Security Engineer but is considered a shared responsibility across the Scrum Team, fostering a more collaborative and security-conscious environment.
Likely correct answers:
    B. Security Engineer collaborates with Scrum Team from the start of the sprint.
    C. All security bugs are properly logged into a bug tracking system.
    D. Security becomes "the whole team's concern".

A could be valid if the Security Engineer is running scans, but it depends on the context of how early or late this happens in Sprint Two. If security scans are introduced late, it may not align well with Agile principles of continuous integration and testing.

2) Reflect on your experience in DevOps with Lego and Chocolate simulation. How many product backlog items (PBI) have been delivered by your group in Sprint One?

B. Between 1 and 5 PBIs. We had a slow start.
C. Over 10 PBIs. We were a high-performing Scrum Team!
D. None. While the Scrum team was able to finish quite a few PBIs, none of them got delivered to the business. Operations had a code freeze.

5) Typical discoveries in Sprint One of the simulation. Select all that apply
A. Disconnect between the team goals and the organizational goals (dev team feels they had a successful sprint, yet, nothing gets delivered to the business).
B. Culture of silos impedes the flow of information in organization.
C. Security Scans performed at the end cause rework and significant delays.
D. All of the above.
E. None of the above.

D. All of the above.

Here's why each point is relevant:

    A. Disconnect between the team goals and the organizational goals (dev team feels they had a successful sprint, yet, nothing gets delivered to the business).
        This can happen when the team focuses on completing tasks within the sprint but fails to align with broader business objectives, leading to a gap between what’s delivered and what the business needs.

    B. Culture of silos impedes the flow of information in organization.
        Often in early stages, teams or departments may still operate in silos, which hinders collaboration and slows down the flow of crucial information.

    C. Security Scans performed at the end cause rework and significant delays.
        If security scans are left until the end of the sprint, issues may arise that could have been identified earlier, causing rework and delays.

Therefore, D. All of the above is correct because each of these is a common discovery in Sprint One as teams begin to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
