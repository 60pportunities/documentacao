### Configurando seu primeiro fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions
Agora que cobrimos os fundamentos do GitHub Actions e discutimos seus benefícios e como ele se compara a outras ferramentas de CI/CD, é hora de mergulhar na criação do seu primeiro fluxo de trabalho. Nesta seção, guiaremos você pelo processo de configuração de um fluxo de trabalho básico do GitHub Actions para automatizar a construção e o teste de um projeto de amostra.

### Crie um novo repositório no GitHub:
Antes de começar, crie um novo repositório no GitHub (se você ainda não tiver um) para hospedar seu projeto. Este repositório servirá como base para seu fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions. Certifique-se de ter inicializado o repositório com um arquivo README e adicionado seus arquivos de projeto.

#### Adicionar um arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:
Os fluxos de trabalho do GitHub Actions são definidos usando arquivos YAML armazenados no diretório .github/workflows dentro do seu repositório. Para criar seu primeiro fluxo de trabalho, siga estas etapas:

- [X] No seu repositório, navegue até a aba "Ações".
- [X] Clique no botão "Novo fluxo de trabalho".
- [X] O GitHub fornece vários modelos de fluxo de trabalho para você escolher. Você pode usar um desses modelos como ponto de partida ou criar um novo fluxo de trabalho do zero clicando em "Configurar um fluxo de trabalho você mesmo".
- [X] Isso criará um novo arquivo YAML no diretório .github/workflows. Dê ao seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho um nome descritivo, como build-and-test.yml.

#### Defina os gatilhos do fluxo de trabalho:
No seu novo arquivo YAML, comece definindo os eventos que devem disparar seu fluxo de trabalho. Para este exemplo, configuraremos o fluxo de trabalho para ser executado em cada solicitação push e pull para o branch principal. Adicione as seguintes linhas ao seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:

```
 on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
```

#### Configure o ambiente do fluxo de trabalho:
Em seguida, especifique o sistema operacional e o ambiente da linguagem de programação para seu fluxo de trabalho. Neste exemplo, usaremos um ambiente baseado em Ubuntu com Node.js. Adicione as seguintes linhas ao seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:

```
jobs:
  build-and-test:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
```
#### Verifique seu repositório:
Para acessar os arquivos do seu repositório dentro do fluxo de trabalho, você precisará verificar o repositório usando a ação actions/checkout. Adicione as seguintes linhas ao seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:

```
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

#### Configure seu ambiente de linguagem de programação:
Neste exemplo, estamos usando Node.js, então precisaremos configurar o ambiente Node.js usando a ação actions/setup-node. Adicione as seguintes linhas ao seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:

```
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
   node-version: 14
```

### Instalar dependências e executar build:
Com o ambiente configurado, agora você pode instalar as dependências do seu projeto e executar o processo de build. Supondo que seu projeto use npm, adicione as seguintes linhas ao seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:

```
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
- name: Build project
  run: npm run build
```

### Executar testes:
Finalmente, adicione uma etapa para executar os testes do seu projeto usando o executor de testes de sua escolha. Neste exemplo, usaremos o npm test. Adicione as seguintes linhas ao seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:

```
- name: Run tests
   run: npm test
```
### Salve e confirme o arquivo de fluxo de trabalho:
Depois de terminar de configurar seu fluxo de trabalho, salve o arquivo YAML e confirme-o em seu repositório. Isso habilitará automaticamente o fluxo de trabalho e ele será acionado com base nos eventos que você definiu.

Com esse fluxo de trabalho básico do GitHub Actions em vigor, seu projeto será criado e testado automaticamente em cada solicitação de push e pull para o branch principal. Este é apenas o começo do que você pode fazer com o GitHub Actions, pois há muito mais opções de personalização e integrações disponíveis para ajudar a simplificar e automatizar seus processos de desenvolvimento.

Conforme você continua a explorar o GitHub Actions, você pode aproveitar o crescente mercado de ações reutilizáveis ​​para expandir seus recursos de fluxo de trabalho, como implantar seu aplicativo em várias plataformas de hospedagem, enviar notificações e integrar com serviços de terceiros.

O design modular e a arquitetura orientada a eventos do GitHub Actions permitem que você crie fluxos de trabalho de automação personalizados que atendem às suas necessidades específicas, garantindo que seus processos de desenvolvimento sejam tão eficientes e simplificados quanto possível.

Nas seções a seguir, nos aprofundaremos nos recursos avançados e nas opções de personalização do GitHub Actions, ajudando você a desbloquear todo o seu potencial e transformar seus fluxos de trabalho de desenvolvimento de software.

### Entendendo a sintaxe YAML
Para trabalhar efetivamente com o GitHub Actions, é essencial entender a sintaxe YAML usada para definir fluxos de trabalho. YAML, que significa "YAML Ain't Markup Language", é um formato de serialização de dados legível por humanos comumente usado para arquivos de configuração e troca de dados entre linguagens com diferentes estruturas de dados. Nesta seção, abordaremos os conceitos básicos da sintaxe YAML e forneceremos exemplos para ajudar você a entender melhor como escrever e manter seus arquivos de fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions.

#### Estrutura básica:
Os arquivos YAML usam recuo para representar a estrutura dos dados, semelhante a como linguagens de programação como Python usam espaços em branco. Os blocos de construção básicos do YAML são escalares (strings, números e booleanos), sequências (matrizes ou listas) e mapeamentos (pares chave-valor ou dicionários). Aqui está um exemplo simples da sintaxe YAML:

```
version: 1 languages:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Go

frameworks:
Python:
  - Django
  - Flask
JavaScript:
  - React
  - Vue
```

#### Escalares:
Escalares são o tipo de dado mais simples em YAML e incluem strings, números e booleanos. Strings podem ser escritas com ou sem aspas, mas geralmente é melhor usar aspas ao lidar com caracteres especiais ou espaços em branco. Números podem ser escritos como inteiros ou valores de ponto flutuante. Booleanos são representados usando true e false. Exemplo:

```
string: "Hello, World!"
integer: 42
float: 3.14
boolean: true
```
#### Sequências:
Sequências são coleções ordenadas de itens, semelhantes a arrays ou listas em linguagens de programação. Em YAML, você pode representar uma sequência iniciando cada item em uma nova linha com um hífen seguido por um espaço. Exemplo:

```
Languages:
   - Python
   - JavaScript
   - Go
```
#### Mappings:
Mapeamentos representam pares chave-valor, semelhantes a dicionários ou mapas hash em linguagens de programação. Em YAML, você pode criar um mapeamento escrevendo a chave, seguida por dois pontos e um espaço, e então o valor. Exemplo:

```
Frameworks:
Python:
  Django
  JavaScript: React
  Go: Gin
```
### Estruturas de dados complexas:
Você pode criar estruturas de dados mais complexas em YAML combinando sequências e mapeamentos. Por exemplo, você pode ter uma sequência de mapeamentos ou um mapeamento com sequências como valores. Exemplo:

```
projects:
- name: Project A
  language: Python
  frameworks:
    - Django
    - Flask
- name: Project B
  language: JavaScript
  frameworks:
     - React
     - Vue
```

### Anchors and aliases:
YAML fornece uma maneira de reutilizar partes da sua configuração usando âncoras e aliases. Uma âncora é definida adicionando & seguido por um nome exclusivo após um valor, enquanto um alias é referenciado usando seguido pelo nome da âncora. Exemplo:

```
defaults: &default_setting
timeout: 10
retries: 3
Job_a:
<<: *default_settings
name: Job A
Job_b:
<<: *default_settings name: Job B
```
#### Multi-line strings:
YAML suporta strings multi-linha usando o caractere pipe '|' ou maior que '>'. O caractere pipe preserva novas linhas na string, enquanto o caractere maior que converte novas linhas em espaços. Exemplo:

```
multiline_pipe: |
This is a multi-line
string with preserved
Newlines.
multiline_gt: >
This is a multi-line
string with newlines
converted to spaces.
Comments:
You can add comments in YAML files by starting a line with the # character. Comments can help document your configuration and make it easier for others to understand your workflow. Example:
# This is a comment in YAML
version: 1 # You can also add inline comments
```
#### Environment variables:
Nos fluxos de trabalho do GitHub Actions, você pode usar variáveis ​​de ambiente para armazenar e passar dados entre etapas. Para definir uma variável de ambiente, use a chave env seguida pelo nome e valor da variável. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
env:
MY_VARIABLE: my_value
steps:
- name: Print environment variable
run: echo $MY_VARIABLE
```

Entender a sintaxe YAML é crucial para trabalhar efetivamente com o GitHub Actions, pois permite que você crie e mantenha fluxos de trabalho complexos e eficientes. Ao dominar os diferentes aspectos do YAML, você pode escrever arquivos de fluxo de trabalho mais sustentáveis, legíveis e escaláveis, garantindo que seus processos de desenvolvimento sejam simplificados e otimizados.

Nas seções a seguir, vamos nos aprofundar nos recursos avançados e opções de personalização do GitHub Actions, ajudando você a desbloquear todo o seu potencial e transformar seus fluxos de trabalho de desenvolvimento de software.

## Anatomy of a GitHub Actions Workflow

Nesta seção, dissecaremos a anatomia de um fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions, explicando cada elemento em detalhes e fornecendo exemplos para ajudar você a compreender sua função e uso.

### Workflow triggers
Os gatilhos de fluxo de trabalho definem os eventos que iniciam a execução de um fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions. Você pode especificar vários eventos, como pushes, pull requests ou até mesmo eventos personalizados, para iniciar o fluxo de trabalho. Os gatilhos são definidos usando a palavra-chave on, seguida pelos nomes dos eventos e qualquer configuração adicional. Exemplo:

```
on:
push:
branches:
   - main
pull_request:
  branches:
   - main
schedule:
   - cron: '0 12 ***
```

### Jobs
Um fluxo de trabalho consiste em um ou mais trabalhos, que são unidades individuais de trabalho que são executadas em paralelo por padrão. Os trabalhos são definidos usando a palavra-chave jobs, seguida por um identificador exclusivo para cada trabalho e sua configuração. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Build project run: npm run build
test:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps:
- name: Run tests run: npm test
```

### Job dependencies
Por padrão, os trabalhos são executados em paralelo, mas você pode especificar dependências entre os trabalhos usando a palavra-chave needs. Isso pode ser útil para criar fluxos de trabalho sequenciais em que certos trabalhos devem ser concluídos antes que outros possam começar. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Build project
run: npm run build
test:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
needs: build
steps:
- name: Run tests
run: npm test
```

### Job environment
Cada trabalho é executado em um ambiente específico definido pela palavra-chave runs-on, que especifica o sistema operacional e a versão do trabalho. O GitHub Actions fornece vários ambientes pré-construídos, como ubuntu-latest, windows-latest e macos-latest. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

### Steps
Os trabalhos são compostos de uma ou mais etapas, que são tarefas individuais executadas sequencialmente dentro de um trabalho. As etapas podem usar ações pré-criadas do mercado GitHub Actions, ações personalizadas ou simplesmente executar comandos shell. As etapas são definidas usando a palavra-chave steps, seguida por uma lista de configurações de etapas. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Set up Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: 14
- name: Install dependencies
run: npm ci
- name: Build project
  run: npm run build
```
### Actions
Ações são unidades reutilizáveis ​​de código que podem ser incluídas como etapas no seu fluxo de trabalho. Você pode usar ações pré-criadas do marketplace GitHub Actions, criar suas próprias ações personalizadas ou referenciar ações de outros repositórios. As ações são referenciadas usando a palavra-chave uses, seguida pelo repositório de ações e versão. Exemplo:

```
steps:
- name: Checkout repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

### Inputs and outputs
Você pode passar dados entre etapas usando entradas e saídas. As entradas são definidas usando a palavra-chave with, seguida por um mapeamento de nomes e valores de entrada. As saídas são definidas usando a palavra-chave id para atribuir um identificador exclusivo a uma etapa e, em seguida, acessadas usando o contexto steps em etapas subsequentes. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
   - name: Generate a random number
       id: random_number
      run: echo "::set-output name=number::$(shuf -i 1-100 -n 1)"

   - name: Print the random number
      run: echo "The random number is ${{ steps.random_number.outputs.number }}"
```

### Environment variables and secrets
Variáveis ​​de ambiente e segredos permitem que você armazene e passe dados sensíveis ou reutilizáveis ​​entre etapas. Variáveis ​​de ambiente são definidas usando a palavra-chave env, enquanto segredos são gerenciados nas configurações do repositório e acessados ​​usando o contexto secrets.Exemplo:

```
jobs:
deploy:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
Env:
API_BASE_URL: "https://api.example.com"
steps:
- name: Deploy application
run: |
echo "Deploying to $API_BASE_URL"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}" -X POST $API_ BASE_URL/deploy
```
### Contexts
Contextos no GitHub Actions fornecem acesso a vários tipos de metadados relacionados à execução atual do fluxo de trabalho, como o evento que acionou o fluxo de trabalho, o repositório, o trabalho, o executor e quaisquer entradas personalizadas. Eles permitem que você crie fluxos de trabalho dinâmicos e flexíveis que podem se adaptar a diferentes situações com base nos metadados disponíveis.

Por exemplo, você pode usar o contexto do github para acessar informações sobre o evento que acionou o fluxo de trabalho, como o tipo de evento, o ator que iniciou o evento e o SHA de confirmação associado. Da mesma forma, o contexto de segredos permite que você acesse com segurança segredos criptografados armazenados nas configurações do seu repositório.

Para acessar dados de contexto, você pode usar a sintaxe `${{context}}` no seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho. Aqui está um exemplo de uso do contexto do github para acessar o nome do evento:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Log event name
run: echo "Event name: ${{ github.event_name}}"
```

### Expressions
Expressões no GitHub Actions são uma maneira poderosa de avaliar e manipular dados dentro dos seus arquivos de fluxo de trabalho. Elas permitem que você execute cálculos, acesse dados de contexto e controle o fluxo do seu fluxo de trabalho com base em condições. As expressões são encapsuladas em chaves duplas, como `${{ expression}}`.

As expressões do GitHub Actions oferecem suporte a uma variedade de funções, operadores e literais que você pode usar para criar lógica complexa em seus fluxos de trabalho. Por exemplo, você pode usar a função contains para verificar se uma string contém uma substring específica ou pode usar o operador `==` para comparar dois valores para igualdade.

Aqui está um exemplo de uso de expressões para executar condicionalmente uma etapa com base no evento que acionou o fluxo de trabalho:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Log event name
   run: echo "This step only runs for pull_request events."
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
```

Neste exemplo, a palavra-chave if é combinada com uma expressão para controlar se a etapa será executada. A etapa será executada somente se o evento que disparou o fluxo de trabalho for um evento de solicitação de pull.

Ao incorporar contextos e expressões em seus fluxos de trabalho do GitHub Actions, você pode criar processos de automação mais dinâmicos, flexíveis e adaptáveis ​​que atendem às necessidades exclusivas de seus projetos de desenvolvimento.

### Workflow status badges:
Para exibir o status dos seus fluxos de trabalho do GitHub Actions no README do seu repositório ou em outra documentação, você pode usar emblemas de status do fluxo de trabalho. A URL do emblema pode ser gerada usando o seguinte padrão: `https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/actions/workflows/<WORKFLOW_FILE>/badge.svg`. Exemplo:

![Build Status](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Ao entender a anatomia de um fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions, você pode criar fluxos de trabalho mais eficientes, sustentáveis ​​e escaláveis, adaptados às suas necessidades específicas. Nas seções a seguir, continuaremos explorando recursos avançados e opções de personalização do GitHub Actions, ajudando você a desbloquear todo o seu potencial e revolucionar seus processos de desenvolvimento de software.

## Building Your First Workflow
Neste capítulo, vamos orientá-lo no processo de criação do seu primeiro fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions do zero. Nosso objetivo é ajudar você a obter uma compreensão prática de como criar e configurar fluxos de trabalho para automatizar várias tarefas em seus projetos de desenvolvimento.

Começaremos discutindo diferentes tipos de gatilhos de fluxo de trabalho, incluindo gatilhos baseados em eventos e gatilhos agendados, que determinam quando seu fluxo de trabalho deve ser executado. Entender esses gatilhos é essencial para projetar fluxos de trabalho que respondam efetivamente a eventos específicos ou sejam executados em um cronograma predeterminado.

Em seguida, vamos nos aprofundar na definição de trabalhos e etapas em seu fluxo de trabalho. Esta seção abordará a estrutura e a configuração de trabalhos, incluindo como definir etapas, usar ações pré-criadas e executar comandos de shell. Ao aprender sobre esses componentes, você poderá criar fluxos de trabalho personalizados adaptados às suas necessidades específicas.

Também exploraremos como aproveitar compilações de matriz e paralelismo para testar seu código com eficiência em vários ambientes, versões de tempo de execução ou configurações. Este recurso poderoso permite que você otimize seus fluxos de trabalho executando várias instâncias de um trabalho simultaneamente, reduzindo o tempo geral de execução e melhorando a confiabilidade.

Ao final deste capítulo, você terá experiência prática na criação e configuração de fluxos de trabalho do GitHub Actions, permitindo que você automatize várias tarefas e processos em seus projetos de desenvolvimento de software. Com uma sólida compreensão desses conceitos fundamentais, você estará pronto para explorar recursos mais avançados e melhores práticas nos capítulos seguintes.

### Workflow Triggers: Events and Scheduling
Nesta seção, vamos nos aprofundar nos diferentes tipos de gatilhos de fluxo de trabalho disponíveis no GitHub Actions. Os gatilhos de fluxo de trabalho são cruciais para definir quando e em quais circunstâncias seus fluxos de trabalho devem ser executados. Entender e utilizar as várias opções de gatilho ajudará você a criar fluxos de trabalho mais eficientes e adaptáveis, adaptados às suas necessidades específicas.

#### Event-based triggers:
Os gatilhos baseados em eventos são o tipo mais comum de gatilhos no GitHub Actions. Esses gatilhos iniciam fluxos de trabalho em resposta a vários eventos que ocorrem no seu repositório, como pushes, pull requests e issues. Alguns dos gatilhos baseados em eventos mais comumente usados ​​incluem:

- [x] push: Aciona o fluxo de trabalho quando os commits são enviados para o repositório.
- [x] pull_request: Aciona o fluxo de trabalho quando um pull request é criado ou atualizado.
- [x] issues: Aciona o fluxo de trabalho quando um problema é aberto, fechado ou atualizado.
- [x] fork: Aciona o fluxo de trabalho quando alguém faz um fork do repositório.

Você pode especificar um ou vários gatilhos baseados em eventos usando a palavra-chave on no seu arquivo de fluxo de trabalho. Além disso, você pode usar filtros para restringir o escopo do gatilho, como especificar branches ou tags específicas. Exemplo:

```
on:
push:
branches:
· main
pull_request:
branches:
- main
types:
- opened
- synchronize
```
#### Scheduled triggers:
Os gatilhos agendados permitem que você execute fluxos de trabalho em intervalos especificados, usando sintaxe semelhante à do cron. Isso é útil para executar tarefas periódicas, como compilações noturnas, relatórios semanais ou manutenção mensal. Para configurar um gatilho agendado, use a palavra-chave schedule e forneça uma ou mais expressões cron. Exemplo:

```
on:
schedule:
- cron: '0 0 * * * # Run the workflow daily at midnight
```
Keep in mind that the schedule is based on the UTC time zone, and the shortest possible interval between scheduled workflow runs is 5 minutes.

#### Manual triggers:
Os gatilhos manuais permitem que você execute fluxos de trabalho sob demanda, usando a interface da web do GitHub Actions ou a API do GitHub. Isso pode ser útil para executar tarefas que não precisam necessariamente ser executadas automaticamente, como implantações, migrações de dados ou scripts únicos. Para configurar um gatilho manual, use a palavra-chave workflow_dispatch e, opcionalmente, forneça parâmetros de entrada. Exemplo:

```
on:
workflow_dispatch:
inputs:
environment:
description: 'The target environment for deployment'
required: true
default: 'staging'
```

Depois de configurar um gatilho manual, você pode iniciar o fluxo de trabalho clicando no botão "Executar fluxo de trabalho" na guia Ações do seu repositório ou usando a API do GitHub.

### External triggers:
Os gatilhos externos permitem que você inicie fluxos de trabalho em resposta a eventos que ocorrem fora do seu repositório, como webhooks de serviços de terceiros ou eventos personalizados de outros repositórios. Para configurar um gatilho externo, use a palavra-chave `repository_dispatch` ou `workflow_dispatch` e forneça uma matriz de tipos com os nomes dos eventos personalizados que você deseja ouvir. Exemplo:

```
on:
repository_dispatch:
types:
- my_custom_event
```

Para acionar um fluxo de trabalho com um evento externo, você pode enviar uma solicitação POST para a API do GitHub com o tipo de evento e a carga útil apropriados.

### Activity triggers:
Os gatilhos de atividade iniciam fluxos de trabalho em resposta a várias atividades do usuário ou do sistema, como marcar um repositório como favorito, criar uma versão ou atribuir um rótulo. Alguns exemplos de gatilhos de atividade incluem:

- [x] watch: Aciona o fluxo de trabalho quando alguém marca o repositório como favorito.
- [x] release: Aciona o fluxo de trabalho quando uma versão é criada, publicada ou atualizada.
- [x] label: Aciona o fluxo de trabalho quando um rótulo é criado, editado ou excluído.

Você pode usar gatilhos de atividade em combinação com outros gatilhos para criar fluxos de trabalho mais flexíveis e responsivos. Exemplo:
```
on:
watch:
types:
- started
release:
types:
- published
```
#### Combining triggers:
Você pode combinar vários gatilhos em um único fluxo de trabalho para manipular vários eventos e cenários. Ao combinar gatilhos, esteja ciente de que cada gatilho pode ter seu próprio conjunto de filtros e opções de configuração. Exemplo:

```
on:
push:
branches:
main
pull_request:
branches:
- main schedule:
- cron: '0 0***1 workflow_dispatch:
inputs:
environment:
description: 'The target environment for deployment'
required: true
default: 'staging'
```

Neste exemplo, o fluxo de trabalho é acionado por push e `pull_request events` no branch principal, é executado diariamente à meia-noite (UTC) e pode ser acionado manualmente com uma entrada de ambiente especificada.

Ao entender e utilizar os diferentes tipos de acionadores de fluxo de trabalho no GitHub Actions, você pode criar fluxos de trabalho que respondem a vários eventos e cenários, tornando seu processo de desenvolvimento mais eficiente e adaptável. Nas próximas seções, discutiremos como criar trabalhos e etapas, usar ações e gerenciar variáveis ​​de ambiente e segredos para construir fluxos de trabalho poderosos e personalizáveis.

### Defining Jobs and Steps
Jobs e steps são blocos de construção fundamentais dos fluxos de trabalho do GitHub Actions. Nesta seção, discutiremos como definir e configurar jobs e steps, criar dependências de job e gerenciar paralelismo e simultaneidade em seus fluxos de trabalho.

### Jobs overview:
Um job é uma unidade individual de trabalho que é executada em um ambiente especificado e consiste em uma ou mais etapas. Os jobs em um fluxo de trabalho são executados em paralelo por padrão, mas você pode criar dependências entre os jobs para impor uma ordem de execução específica. Os jobs são definidos usando a palavra-chave jobs, seguida por um identificador exclusivo para cada job e sua configuração. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
- name: Build project
  run: npm run
build
 test:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Run tests
   run: npm test
```
#### Configuring jobs:
Cada trabalho tem um conjunto de propriedades que você pode configurar, como o ambiente em que o trabalho é executado, suas dependências e suas configurações de tempo limite e repetição.

- [x] runs-on: Especifica o sistema operacional e a versão do trabalho. Exemplos incluem ubuntu-latest, windows-latest e macos-latest.
- [x] needs: Especifica as dependências entre os trabalhos, garantindo que um trabalho seja executado somente após os trabalhos especificados terem sido concluídos com sucesso.
- [x] timeout-minutes: Define um tempo limite para o trabalho, após o qual ele será cancelado se não tiver sido concluído.
- [x] continue-on-error: Configura se o trabalho deve continuar se uma etapa falhar.
- [x] strategy: Define a configuração da matriz para executar várias instâncias de um trabalho com diferentes variáveis ​​de ambiente, sistemas operacionais ou configurações.

### Defining steps:
Etapas são tarefas individuais que são executadas sequencialmente dentro de um trabalho. Cada etapa pode executar um comando shell, usar uma ação pré-criada do marketplace GitHub Actions ou referenciar uma ação personalizada. As etapas são definidas usando a palavra-chave steps, seguida por uma lista de configurações de etapas. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Checkout repository
uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Set up Node.js
uses: actions/setup-node@v2 with:
node-version: 14
- name: Install dependencies
run: npm ci
- name: Build project
run: npm run build
```

#### Configuring steps:
Cada etapa tem um conjunto de propriedades que você pode configurar, como seu nome, a ação que ela usa e os parâmetros de entrada para a ação.

- [x] name: especifica um nome legível para a etapa, que é exibido na interface da web do GitHub Actions.
- [x] uses: faz referência a uma ação pré-criada do mercado do GitHub Actions, uma ação personalizada ou uma ação de outro repositório. A sintaxe é <owner>/<repo>@<ref>, onde <owner> é o proprietário do repositório, <repo> é o nome do repositório e <ref> é uma referência de branch, tag ou commit.
- [x] with: fornece parâmetros de entrada para uma ação. Os parâmetros disponíveis dependem da ação específica que está sendo usada.
- [x] run: executa um comando shell ou script dentro do ambiente do trabalho.
- [x] env: define variáveis ​​de ambiente para uma etapa específica.
- [x] if: adiciona uma expressão condicional que determina se uma etapa deve ser executada. A etapa só será executada se a expressão for avaliada como verdadeira.

#### Job dependencies and parallelism:
Por padrão, os trabalhos são executados em paralelo. No entanto, você pode criar dependências entre os trabalhos usando a palavra-chave needs para impor uma ordem de execução específica.

Um trabalho com uma propriedade needs só será iniciado após todos os trabalhos especificados terem sido concluídos com sucesso. Isso permite que você crie fluxos de trabalho complexos com vários estágios, como construir, testar e implantar seu aplicativo. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Build project
run: npm run build
test:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
needs: build
steps:
- name: Run tests
run: npm test
deploy:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
needs: test
steps:
- name: Deploy to production
run: npm run deploy
```

Neste exemplo, o trabalho de teste depende do trabalho de construção, e o trabalho de implantação depende do trabalho de teste. Isso impõe uma ordem de execução sequencial, garantindo que a implantação só aconteça depois que os trabalhos de construção e teste forem concluídos com sucesso.

#### Matrix strategy:
A estratégia matrix permite que você execute várias instâncias de um trabalho com diferentes variáveis ​​de ambiente, sistemas operacionais ou configurações.
Isso pode ser útil para testar seu aplicativo em várias plataformas ou versões. Para configurar uma estratégia matrix, use a palavra-chave strategy e forneça uma configuração matrix. Exemplo:

```
jobs:
  test:
     runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
     strategy:
        matrix:
           os: [ubuntu-latest,windows-latest,macos-latest]
           node-version: [12, 14, 16]
     steps:
        - name: Set up Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
             node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        - name: Run tests
          run: npm test
```

Neste exemplo, o trabalho de teste será executado em três sistemas operacionais diferentes (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest e macos-latest) e três versões diferentes do Node.js (12, 14 e 16), resultando em um total de nove instâncias de trabalho.

Ao entender e utilizar efetivamente trabalhos e etapas em seus fluxos de trabalho do GitHub Actions, você pode criar fluxos de trabalho poderosos, adaptáveis ​​e eficientes que atendem aos seus requisitos específicos. Nas próximas seções, exploraremos ações, variáveis ​​de ambiente, segredos e outros recursos avançados que ajudarão você a aproveitar todo o potencial do GitHub Actions.

### Using Pre-Built Actions
Ações pré-construídas são componentes reutilizáveis ​​criados pela comunidade do GitHub e pela equipe do GitHub Actions que ajudam a automatizar tarefas comuns, tornando seus fluxos de trabalho mais eficientes e fáceis de manter. Nesta seção, discutiremos como encontrar, usar e configurar ações pré-construídas e explorar algumas ações populares que você pode incorporar em seus fluxos de trabalho.

### Finding pre-built actions:
O GitHub Actions Marketplace é a principal fonte para descobrir e compartilhar ações pré-criadas. Você pode acessar o marketplace visitando a seguinte URL: `https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions`

Alternativamente, você pode navegar até a aba "Ações" no seu repositório, clicar em "Novo fluxo de trabalho" e então clicar em "Marketplace" para visualizar uma lista com curadoria de ações adaptadas à linguagem e estrutura do seu repositório.

Ao selecionar uma ação, considere sua popularidade, status de manutenção e a confiabilidade do seu autor. Ler a documentação, as avaliações e o código-fonte da ação pode ajudar você a tomar uma decisão informada.

### Using pre-built actions:
Para usar uma ação pré-criada no seu fluxo de trabalho, adicione uma nova etapa ao seu trabalho e use a palavra-chave uses, seguida pelo repositório da ação no formato `<owner>/<repo>@<ref>`. Exemplo:

```
 jobs:
  build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
          - name: Checkout repository
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
              node-version: 14
```

Neste exemplo, a ação actions/checkout@v2 verifica o código do seu repositório, e a ação actions/setup-node@v2 configura o Node.js com a versão especificada.

### Configuring pre-built actions:
Many actions provide input parameters that you can use to customize their behaviour. To set input parameters, use the with key- word followed by a key-value map of parameter names and values. Example:

```
jobs:
  deploy:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Deploy to Firebase
         uses: w9jds/firebase-action@v1.5.0
         with:
           args: deploy --only hosting
         env: FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

In this example, the w9jds/firebase-action@v1.5.0 action deploys your application to Firebase Hosting, with the specified arguments. The action also requires a FIREBASE_TOKEN environment variable, which is provided as a secret.

### Popular pre-built actions:
There are numerous pre-built actions available in the GitHub Actions Marketplace, covering various tasks such as code quality checks, deployments, and notifications. Here are some popular actions that you might find useful in your workflows:

- [X] actions/checkout: Checks out your repository's code so that your workflow can access and manipulate it.
- [X] actions/setup-node: Sets up a specific version of Node.js in your job's environment.
- [X] actions/cache: Caches dependencies and build artifacts to speed up your workflow.
- [X] actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact: Uploads and downloads build artifacts, such as compiled binar- ies or test results, to share between jobs or store as workflow outputs.
- [X] actions/create-release: Creates a new GitHub release and up- loads assets to it.
- [X] actions/slack: Sends notifications to a Slack channel.

Remember to consult the action's documentation and source code to understand its functionality, requirements, and limitations.

### Security considerations:
When using pre-built actions, be aware of the potential security risks associated with running third-party code in your workflows. To mitigate these risks, follow these best practices:

- [X] Review the action's source code and documentation to understand its functionality and ensure it doesn't contain malicious or insecure code.
- [X] Use specific version tags or commit hashes instead of branch names when referencing actions. This helps prevent unexpected changes in the action's behaviour due to updates or modifications.
- [X] Keep your actions up-to-date to benefit from bug fixes, security patches, and new features. Regularly check for new releases and update your workflows accordingly.
- [X] Limit access to sensitive information, such as secrets and environment variables, in your workflows. Make sure to pro- vide only the necessary permissions and data to the actions you use.

By using pre-built actions in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can leverage the power of the GitHub community to automate various tasks, save time, and streamline your development process.

As you become more familiar with GitHub Actions, you may also consider creating your own custom actions to further tailor your workflows to your specific needs. In the next sections, we will
discuss advanced topics such as managing environment variables, secrets and creating custom actions.

### Running Shell Commands
In addition to using pre-built actions, you can execute shell commands and scripts directly in your GitHub Actions workflows. This provides you with the flexibility to perform custom tasks, manipulate files, or interact with external tools and services. In this section, we will discuss how to run shell commands, control the shell environment, and manage exit codes and error handling in your workflows.

### Executing shell commands:
To execute a shell command in your workflow, add a new step to your job and use the run keyword, followed by the command or script you want to execute. Example:

## Multi-line and chained commands:
You can execute multiple commands in a single step by using multi-line YAML strings or chaining commands with shell operators. Example:

```
 jobs:
   test:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
        - name: Install dependencies and run tests
           run: |
                 npm ci
                 npm test
        - name: Build and deploy
           run: npm run build && npm run deploy
```
In this example, the first step installs the dependencies and runs the tests using a multi-line YAML string, while the second step builds and deploys the project using a chained command with the && shell operator.

### Specifying the shell:
GitHub Actions supports various shells, including Bash, PowerShell, and Windows Command Prompt. By default, the shell used depends on the operating system of the runner. You can specify the shell to use with the shell keyword. Example:

```
jobs:
custom-shell:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
 - name: Run script in custom shell
   run: echo "Hello, World!"
   shell: python {0}
```
In this example, the echo "Hello, World!" command is executed using the Python interpreter as a custom shell.

In this example, the first step installs the dependencies and runs the tests using a multi-line YAML string, while the second step builds and deploys the project using a chained command with the && shell operator.

### Environment variables:
You can set environment variables for a specific step or an entire job using the env keyword. Environment variables can be accessed in shell commands and scripts using the appropriate syntax for the shell being used. Example:

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Deploy with environment variable
          run: npm run deploy -- --token $TOKEN
          env:TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```

In this example, the TOKEN environment variable is set to the value of the DEPLOY_TOKEN secret and is used as an argument in the npm run deploy command.

### Exit codes and error handling
By default, a step fails if the shell command or script returns a non-zero exit code. To control the error handling behavior, you can use the continue-on-error and if keywords.

- [x] continue-on-error : Set to true if the job should continue even if the step fails. The default value is false.
- [x] if: Adds a conditional expression that determines whether a step should run. The step will only run if the expression evaluates to true.

Example:
```
jobs:
  build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run linter
         run: npm run lint
         continue-on-error: true
         - name: Run tests
            run: npm test
         - name: Deploy
            run: npm run deploy
            if: success()
```
In this example, the Run linter step is configured to continue on error, allowing the workflow to proceed even if the linter fails. The Deploy step uses a conditional expression with the if keyword, ensuring that it only runs if the previous steps were successful.

### Working directory:
By default, shell commands and scripts are executed in the repository's root directory. You can change the working directory for a specific step or an entire job using the working-directory keyword.Example:
```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Build frontend
          run: npm run build
          working-directory: frontend
        - name: Build backend
           run: npm run build
           working-directory: backend
```
In this example, the Build frontend and Build backend steps are executed in the frontend and backend directories, respectively.

### Running scripts from files:
Instead of writing shell commands directly in the workflow file, you can execute scripts from external files. This is particularlyuseful for managing complex or reusable scripts. Example:
```
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Execute deployment script
            run: ./scripts/deploy.sh
```
In this example, the Execute deployment script step runs the deploy.sh script from the scripts directory.

Running shell commands in your GitHub Actions workflows provides you with the flexibility to perform a wide range of tasks, from simple one-liners to complex scripts.

By combining shell commands with pre-built actions and advanced features like environment variables and conditional execution, you can create powerful, versatile, and efficient workflows tailored to your project's needs.

In the next sections, we will explore topics like managing secrets, conditional execution, and creating custom actions to further enhance your GitHub Actions workflows.

## Managing Workflow Execution
In this chapter, we will focus on managing and optimizing the execution of your GitHub Actions workflows.

By learning how to control and fine-tune your workflows, you can ensure that they run efficiently, effectively, and securely, while also minimizing the consumption of resources.

First, we will discuss environment variables and secrets, which are essential for managing configuration data and securely storing sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials.

You will learn how to define, access, and use environment variables and secrets within your workflows to make them more flexible andsecure.

Next, we will explore job and step-level conditions, which enable you to control the execution of specific jobs or steps based on certain criteria.

We will cover various types of conditional expressions, such as basic conditional execution, combining expressions with logical operators, and filtering by event type or branch.

By incorporating these conditions into your workflows, you can create more dynamic and adaptable automation processes.

Lastly, we will dive into matrix builds and parallelization, which we briefly touched upon in the previous chapter. This section will provide a more in-depth look at these features, explaining how they can help you optimize resource usage, reduce workflow runtime, and improve overall maintainability.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a thorough understanding of how to manage and optimize GitHub Actions workflow execution, allowing you to create robust, efficient, and secure automation processes for your development projects.

### Environment Variables and Secrets
Managing sensitive data and configuration values is crucial for maintaining the security and flexibility of your workflows.

Environment variables and secrets provide a way to store and access this data without hardcoding it in your workflow files. In this setion, we will discuss how to define, use, and manage environment variables and secrets in your GitHub Actions workflows.

#### Environment variables:
Environment variables are key-value pairs that are available to your workflow's steps as they execute. They can store configuration values, paths, or other data that you want to access across multiple steps or jobs. You can set environment variables at three different levels:

- [x] Repository level: Set in your repository's settings and apply to all workflows in the repository;
- [x] Workflow level: Set in the workflow file with the env keyword and apply to all jobs in the workflow.
- [x] Job or step level: Set in the workflow file with the env key- word and apply only to the specific job or step.Example:

```
  name: My Workflow
   env:
     GLOBAL_VARIABLE: "Global value"
   jobs:
     build:runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     env:
       JOB_VARIABLE: "Job value"
     steps:
        - name: Print environment variables
           run:
               |
                 echo "Global variable: $GLOBAL_VARIABLE"
                 echo "Job variable: $JOB_VARIABLE"
                 echo "Step variable: $STEP_VARIABLE"
            env:
                 STEP_VARIABLE: "Step value"
```

In this example, environment variables are set at the repository, workflow, job, and step levels. The Print environment variables step accesses and prints their values using the appropriate syntax for the shell being used.

### Secrets:
Secrets are encrypted environment variables that store sensitive data, such as access tokens, passwords, or API keys.

Secrets are not exposed in logs or available to users with read access to the repository, providing a secure way to store and use sensitive data in your workflows.
To create a secret, navigate to your repository's "Settings" tab, thenclick on "Secrets" in the left sidebar.

Click on "New repository secret" to add a new secret, providing a name and a value.

To use a secret in your workflow, reference it using the secrets context in an expression.Secrets can be assigned to environment variables or used directly in expressions.Example:
```
jobs:
  deploy:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
          - name: Deploy with secret token
             run: npm run deploy -- --token $TOKEN
             env: TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```
In this example, the DEPLOY_TOKEN secret is assigned to the TOKEN environment variable, which is then used as an argument in the npm run deploy command.

### Masking and redacting secrets:
GitHub Actions automatically masks and redacts secrets in logs to prevent accidental exposure. If a secret value is detected in the logs, it is replaced with the *** character sequence. To ensure that secrets are masked correctly, avoid using secrets with very short or common values, and validate user input if it's used to construct secrets.

#### Organization and environment secrets:
In addition to repository secrets, GitHub Actions supports organization secrets and environment secrets. Organization secrets can be shared across multiple repositories within an organization, while environment secrets are scoped to specific environments and require approval to be accessed by a workflow.

### Limiting secret access:
By default, secrets are not passed to workflows that are triggered by a pull request from a forked repository.
This helps prevent unauthorized access to your secrets. To provide limited access to secrets for forked repositories, you can use the pull_request_target event in combination with additional checks and conditions in your workflow. Example:

```
  on:
    pull_request_target:
       types: [opened, synchronize]
        jobs:
          check_pr:
              runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                steps:
                  - name: Check for approval
                    id: check
                    run: |
                         # Add logic to check if the PR is approved,
                         #e.g., by a specific user or using labels
                         if [ "${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login}}" =="trusted-user"]; then
                           echo "::set-output name=approved::true"
                         Else
                           echo "::set-output name=approved::false"
                        Fi
                        deploy:
                          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                            needs: check_pr
                            if: ${{ steps.check.outputs.approved == 'true'}}
                            steps:
                              - name: Deploy with secret token
                                 run: npm run deploy -- --token $TOKEN
                                 env:
                                   TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
```
In this example, the check_pr job checks if the pull request is approved based on custom logic (e.g., by a specific user or using labels). The deploy job uses the needs keyword to depend on the check_pr job and the if keyword to conditionally execute the deployment step if the pull request is approved.

By effectively managing environment variables and secrets in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can securely store sensitive data and configuration values, providing a flexible and maintainable way to manage your workflow execution. In the following sections, we will explore more advanced topics such as conditional execution, matrix strategies, and creating custom actions to fur- ther enhance your GitHub Actions workflows.

### Job and Step-Level Conditions
Conditional execution is a powerful feature that allows you to control when jobs and steps run based on specific criteria. In this section, we'll cover various aspects of using conditions in your GitHub Actions workflows.Basic Conditional ExecutionThe basic conditional execution feature in GitHub Actions allows you to control when jobs or steps within your workflows run based on specific criteria.

By using the if keyword followed by a conditional expression, you can determine whether a job or step should execute. The job or step will only run if the expression evaluates totrue.To set a condition for a job, add the if keyword at the job level in your workflow file:

```
jobs:
  build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' }}
         steps:
              - name: Build project
                 run: npm run build
```

In this example, the build job will only run if the event that triggered the workflow is a push event.

Similarly, you can set conditions for individual steps within a job by adding the if keyword at the step level:
```
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Run tests on the main branch
           if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
           run: npm run test:main
          - name: Run tests on other branches
           if: ${{ github.ref!= 'refs/heads/main' }}
             run: npm run test
```
In this example, the Run tests on the main branch step will execute only if the current branch is the main branch. Conversely, the Run tests on other branches step will execute if the current branch is not the main branch.

Using basic conditional execution, you can tailor your workflows to respond to different events or branches, optimizing resource usage and reducing overall runtime. This makes your workflows more efficient and adaptable, ultimately simplifying their maintenance.

### Contexts and Functions in Conditions
When defining conditional expressions in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can use various contexts and functions to create more dynamic and complex conditions.
Contexts provide access to data about the current workflow run, repository, and event, while functions offer a way to manipulate and evaluate this data. Here's an overview of some commonly used contexts and functions:

1. Contexts:
- [x] github: Provides access to data related to the current workflow run, repository, and event. Some commonly used properties include github.event_name, github.ref, and github.actor.
- [x] secrets: Allows you to reference encrypted secrets stored in your repository.needs: Enables you to access the output of previously completed jobs within the same workflow.- [x] steps: Grants access to the output of previous steps within the same job.env: References environment variables defined at the workflow, job, or step level.

2. Functions:
- [x] success(): Returns true if all the previous steps or jobs in the workflow have completed successfully, and false otherwise.
- [x] failure() : Returns true if any of the previous steps or jobs in the workflow have failed, and false otherwise.
- [x] cancelled(): Returns true if any of the previous steps or jobs in the workflow have been cancelled, and false otherwise.
- [x] startsWith(), endsWith(), and contains() : String manipulation functions that can be used to check if a stringExample:jobs:deploy:starts with, ends with, or contains a specific substring, respectively.
- [x] fromJson(): Parses a JSON string and returns a JSON object that can be used in expressions.

```
jobs:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: ${{ github.event_name steps:=='push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main')}}
     - name: Checkout repository
       uses: actions/checkout@v2
     - name: Deployrun: npm run deploy
        env:API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY}}
```
In this example, the deploy job will only run if the event that triggered the workflow is a push event and the current branch is the main branch.

The API_KEY secret is also used as an environment variable for the Deploy step.

By using contexts and functions in your conditions, you can create more versatile workflows that respond dynamically to different events, branches, statuses, and other relevant criteria. This allows you to optimize resource usage, reduce runtime, and improve the maintainability of your GitHub Actions workflows.

### Combining Expressions with Logical Operators
In GitHub Actions, you can combine expressions in your conditional statements using logical operators to create more complex conditions. This flexibility allows you to tailor your workflows to run or skip jobs and steps based on multiple criteria, further optimizing resource usage and runtime.

The following logical oper- ators are available for use in conditional expressions:

1. `&& (and)`: Evaluates to true if both the left and right expressions are true, and false otherwise.
2. `|| (or)`: Evaluates to true if either the left or right expression is true, and false otherwise.
3. `! (not)`: Negates the truth value of the expression that follows it. Returns true if the expression is false, and false if the ex- pression is true.

Example:
```
jobs:
  Build_and_test:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      if: ${{ github.event_name=='push' && (startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main') || contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[build]')) }}
      steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```
In this example, the build_and_test job will only run if the event that triggered the workflow is a push event and either the current branch is the main branch or the commit message contains the [build] string.

By combining expressions with logical operators, you can create more nuanced conditions for executing jobs and steps in your Git- Hub Actions workflows. This added level of control enables you to create more efficient and adaptable workflows, ultimately simplifying their maintenance and improving resource management.

### Conditional Job Dependencies
Conditional job dependencies in GitHub Actions enable you to create dependencies between jobs and control their execution order based on the success or failure of previous jobs. This functionality can help you optimize resource usage, reduce runtime, and improve the maintainability of your workflows.

To create a job dependency, use the needs keyword at the job level, followed by the name of the job(s) it depends on. The dependent job will only run if all the jobs it depends on have completed successfully.Example:
```
jobs:
   build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Checkout repository
         uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Install dependencies
         run: npm ci
       - name: Build project
         run: npm run
    buildtest:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      needs: build
      steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm
      testdeploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs:
         teststeps:
        - name: Checkout repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Deploy
             run: npm run deploy
```
In this example, the test job depends on the successful completion of the build job, and the deploy job depends on the successful completion of the test job.

The jobs will run in sequence, and if any job fails, the subsequent jobs will not run.

You can also use conditional expressions with the needs keyword to create more complex dependencies:

```
jobs:
  build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Install dependencies
             run: npm ci
          - name: Build project
            run: npm run
      buildtest:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          needs: build
          if: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' || !contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'skip-tests') }}
          steps:
            - name: Checkout repository
              uses: actions/checkout@v2
            - name: Install dependencies
               run: npm ci
            - name: Run tests
               run: npm test
      deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          needs: test
          if: ${{ success() }}
            steps:
              - name: Checkout repository
                uses: actions/checkout@v2
              - name: Deploy
                 run: npm run deploy
```

In this modified example, the test job will only run if the build job is successful and either the event is not a pull request or the pull request does not have a label named "skip-tests".

The deploy job will run only if the test job is successful.

By leveraging conditional job dependencies in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can create more efficient and flexible workflows that respond dynamically to the success or failure of previous jobs, ultimately simplifying workflow maintenance and improving resource management.

### Skipping Jobs and Steps
In GitHub Actions, you can skip jobs or steps within your workflows based on specific conditions by using the if keyword followed by a conditional expression.

If the expression evaluates to false, the job or step will be skipped.

Skipping unnecessary jobs or steps can help you optimize resource usage, reduce runtime, and improve the maintainability of your workflows.

To skip a job, add the if keyword at the job level in your workflow file:
```
jobs:
  deploy:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main')}}
  steps:
   - name: Checkout repository
     uses: actions/checkout@v2
   - name: Deploy to production
     run: npm run deploy
```

In this example, the deploy job will only run if the event that triggered the workflow is a push event and the current branch is the main branch.

Otherwise, the job will be skipped.

Similarly, you can skip individual steps within a job by adding the if keyword at the step level:
```
jobs:
 test:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Upload test coverage
        if: ${{ success()}}
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
           with:
             name: test-coverage
             path: coverage/
```

In this example, the Upload test coverage step will only run if all the previous steps within the test job have completed successfully. If any previous step fails, the step will be skipped.

By using conditional expressions to skip jobs and steps in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can create more efficient and adaptable workflows that respond dynamically to different events, branches, and statuses.

This added level of control enables you to optimize resource usage and reduce runtime, ultimately simplifying workflow maintenance and improving resource management.

### Filtering by Event Type or Branch
Filtering jobs and steps based on event type or branch in GitHub Actions allows you to create more targeted workflows that respond specifically to the context in which they are run.
By using conditional expressions with the if keyword, you can control when a job or step is executed based on the event that triggered the workflow or the current branch.

### Filtering by Event Type
To filter a job or step based on the event type, use the github.event_name context in your conditional expression.
This context provides access to the name of the event that triggered the workflow.
Example:
```
jobs:
  deploy:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push'}}
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Deploy to production
           run: npm run deploy
```

In this example, the deploy job will only run if the event that triggered the workflow is a push event. Otherwise, the job will be skipped.

#### Filtering by Branch
To filter a job or step based on the current branch, use the github.ref context in your conditional expression.
This context provides access to the branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow. Example:

```
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main') }}
     steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Deploy to production
            run: npm run deploy
```
In this example, the deploy job will only run if the current branch is the main branch.
Otherwise, the job will be skipped.

### Combining Event Type and Branch Filtering:
You can also combine event type and branch filtering in a single conditional expression using logical operators like && (and) or || (or).
Example:
```
jobs:
  Deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/main')}}
     steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Deploy to production
       run: npm run deploy
```

In this example, the deploy job will only run if the event that triggered the workflow is a push event and the current branch is the main branch.
Otherwise, the job will be skipped.By filtering jobs and steps based on event type or branch in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can create more focused and efficient workflows that run only when necessary.

This increased level of control helps optimize resource usage, reduce runtime, and improve overall workflow maintainability.

### Error Handling and continue-on-error
Error handling is a crucial aspect of building robust GitHub Actions workflows.
By default, if a step fails, the entire job will be marked as failed, and any subsequent steps will not be executed.
However, there might be cases where you want a job to continue running even if a step encounters an error.
The continue-on-error keyword allows you to control this behaviour and ensure that your workflows can gracefully handle errors and continue running when necessary.
Using continue-on-errorTo use continue-on-error in your workflow, add the keyword at the step level and set its value to true.
This will instruct GitHub Actions to continue executing the remaining steps in the job even if the current step encounters an error.Example:
```
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout repository
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: npm ci
        - name: Run linter
          run: npm run lint
      continue-on-error: true
        - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
```
In this example, the Run linter step is configured with continue-on-error: true.
If the linter encounters an error (e.g., it finds code style violations), the step will be marked as failed, but the job will continue executing the remaining steps, such as running the tests.

### Customizing error handling behaviour
You can also use conditional expressions with the continue-on-error keyword to customize the error handling behaviour based on specific conditions.
Example:
```
jobs:
  build:
   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   steps:
     - name: Checkout repository
       uses: actions/checkout@v2
     - name: Install dependencies
       run: npmci
      - name: Run linter
         run: npm run lint
      continue-on-error: ${{ github.event_name=='pull_request'}}
        - name: Run tests
           run: npm test
```
In this modified example, the continue-on-error value is set to a conditional expression that evaluates to true if the event that triggered the workflow is a pull request.

This means that if the workflow is triggered by a pull request event and the linter encounters an error, the job will continue executing the remaining steps.

However, if the workflow is triggered by another event type, such as a push event, the job will be marked as failed and the remaining steps will not be executed.

By using the continue-on-error keyword and conditional expressions in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can create more resilient and adaptable workflows that can gracefully handle errors and continue running when appropriate.
This added level of control enables you to optimize resource usage, reduce runtime, and improve overall workflow maintainability.

### Creating Custom GitHub Actions
In this chapter, we will guide you through the process of creating custom GitHub Actions to expand the capabilities of your workflows beyond the pre-built actions available in the GitHub Marketplace.

Custom actions allow you to tailor your automation processes to the specific needs of your development projects and implement unique functionality that might not be available in existing actions.

We will begin by discussing the two primary types of custom actions: Docker-based actions and JavaScript-based actions.

You will learn about their key differences, advantages, and limitations, enabling you to make informed decisions about which type of action is best suited for your particular use case.
Next, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to create your own custom actions, covering the structure, components, and development process for both Docker-based and JavaScript-based actions.

This hands-on approach will ensure you gain practical experience and a deep understanding of how to create custom actions effectively.
Throughout the chapter, we will also share tips, best practices, and recommendations for action development, including how to write maintainable code, ensure proper error handling, and optimize performance.

These insights will help you create high-quality, reusable custom actions that can be shared with the community or used privately within your organization.
By the end of this chapter, you will be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to create custom GitHub Actions, enabling you to expand your automation capabilities and tailor your workflows to meet the unique requirements of your development projects.

### Docker-based Actions vs. JavaScript-based Actions
In this section, we will compare and contrast the two primary types of custom GitHub Actions:Docker-based Actions and JavaScript-based Actions.
Understanding the differences between these action types, as well as their respective advantages and limitations, will help you make informed decisions when creating custom actions for your workflows.

### Introduction to Docker-based Actions
Docker-based Actions are GitHub Actions that run inside a Docker container. This means that the action's runtime environment is isolated and can be customized to include any dependencies required by the action.

### Advantages of Docker-based Actions
- [x] Highly customizable and self-contained environment.
- [x] Consistent execution environment, ensuring the action behaves the same way across different runners.
Can be written in any programming language, as long as the language runtime is available in the Docker container.

### Limitations of Docker-based Actions
Can only be executed on Linux runners, as Docker is not supported on macOS or Windows runners.

Slower startup time, due to the overhead of building and running the Docker container.

### Introduction to JavaScript-based Actions
JavaScript-based Actions are GitHub Actions that run directly on the runner's host machine using Node.js.
These actions require fewer resources compared to Docker-based Actions, as they do not run inside a container.

#### Advantages of JavaScript-based Actions
Faster startup time, as there is no need to build or run a Docker container.
Can be executed on any platform, including Linux, macOS, and Windows runners.
Easier to create and maintain, as they only require a single entry point script written in JavaScript or TypeScript.

#### Limitations of JavaScript-based Actions
Limited to JavaScript or TypeScript, as the action runs directly on the Node.js runtime.
The action's dependencies and runtime environment must be compatible with the runner's host environment.

### Choosing the Right Action Type for Your Workflow
When deciding between Docker-based and JavaScript-based Actions, consider the following factors:
- [X] Platform compatibility: If your workflow needs to run on macOS or Windows runners, JavaScript-based Actions are the better choice.
- [X] Startup time: If minimizing startup time is crucial, Java-Script-based Actions generally offer faster execution.
- [X] Customization and dependencies: If your action requires a highly customized environment or has complex dependencies, Docker-based Actions might be more suitable.
- [X] Programming language: If you prefer to use a programming language other than JavaScript or TypeScript, Docker-based Actions offer greater flexibility.

In conclusion, both Docker-based and JavaScript-based Actions have their merits and limitations.
Carefully consider the specific needs of your workflow and the factors mentioned above to determine the most appropriate action type for your custom GitHub Actions.

### Building a Docker-based Action
In this section, we will walk you through the process of creating a custom Docker-based GitHub Action.
By following these steps, you will learn how to develop, test, and publish your own Docker-based Action for use in your workflows.

#### Set up the project structure
First, create a new directory for your action and navigate to it:
```
mkdir my-docker-action
cd my-docker-action
```
Next, create the following files and folders inside the project directory:

Dockerfile: The Dockerfile defines the container image for your action, including the base image, runtime, and dependencies.
entrypoint.sh: This shell script serves as the entry point for your action, containing the code that will be executed whenthe action runs.
README.md : A README file that documents your action, including usage instructions, input parameters, and output values.

### Configure the Dockerfile
Edit the Dockerfile and specify the base image, dependencies, and other configurations.
For example, if your action requires Python, you could use the following Dockerfile:
```
FROM python:3.8-slim
# Install any additional dependencies
RUN pip install requests
# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy the entrypoint script into the container
COPY entrypoint.sh /app
# Make the script executable
RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh
# Set the entrypoint for the container
ENTRYPOINT ["/app/entrypoint.sh"]
```
#### Implement the entrypoint script
Edit the entrypoint.sh file and write the code that your action will execute.
For instance, the following script fetches data from an API and prints the response:
```
#!/bin/sh -1
set-e
API_URL="https://api.example.com/data"
echo "Fetching data from $API_URL..."
response=$(curl -s "$API_URL")
echo "Response from API:"
echo "$response"
```
Make sure to set the correct permissions on the entrypoint.sh file:

```
chmod +x entrypoint.sh
```
### Test your action locally
Before publishing your action, test it locally by building and running the Docker container:
```
docker build -t my-docker-action.
docker run --rm my-docker-action
```
If everything works as expected, you can proceed to the next step.

### Publish your action
To make your action available for use in workflows, push the project to a GitHub repository.
Make sure to include a README.md file with instructions on how to use your action, including any required input parameters and expected output values.
Once your action is published, you can reference it in your workflows by using the uses keyword with the repository's URL:
```
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Run My Docker Action
          uses: your-username/my-docker-action@main
```
That's it! You have now successfully created a custom Docker-based GitHub Action.
By following these steps, you can develop and publish your own actions to automate various tasks and processes in your workflows.

### Building a JavaScript-based Action
In this section, we will guide you through the process of creating a custom JavaScript-based GitHub Action.
By following these steps, you will learn how to develop, test, and publish your own Java-Script-based Action for use in your workflows.

### Set up the project structure
First, create a new directory for your action and navigate to it:
```
mkdir my-js-action
cd my-js-action
```
Next, create the following files and folders inside the project directory:

- [x] index.js: The entry point for your action, containing the Java-Script code that will be executed when the action runs.
- [x] action.yml : A YAML file that defines your action's metadata, including its name, description, inputs, and outputs.
- [x] README.md: A README file that documents your action, including usage instructions, input parameters, and output values.
- [x] package.json: The project's package manifest, which lists dependencies and other configurations.
### Configure the action.yml file
Edit the action.yml file and specify the metadata for your action, including its name, description, inputs, and outputs.
```
For example:name: 'My JavaScript Action'
description: 'Perform a custom task using a JavaScript-based GitHub Action'
inputs:
  input1:
     description: 'An example input parameter'
     required: true
     outputs:
       output1:
           description: 'An example output value'
           runs:
             using: 'node12'
            main:
               'index.js'
```
### Implement the index.js file
Edit the index.js file and write the JavaScript code that your action will execute.
Make sure to import the @actions/core and @actions/ github packages to interact with GitHub Actions.
For instance, the following script fetches data from an API and sets an output value:
```
const core = require('@actions/core');
const axios = require('axios');
(async() => {try {const apiUrl = 'https://api.example.com/data';
console.log(`Fetching data from ${apiUrl}...`);
const response = await axios.get(apiUrl);
console.log('Response from API:', response.data);
core.setOutput('output1', response.data);}
catch (error) {console.error(error.message);
core.setFailed(error.message);}})0;
```

### Install dependencies and configurethe package.json file
Install the required dependencies using npm:

npm init -y npm install @actions/core @actions/github axios

### Test your action locally
Before publishing your action, test it locally by running the index.js file with Node.js:
node index.js

If everything works as expected, you can proceed to the next step.
Publish your actionTo make your action available for use in workflows, push the pro- ject to a GitHub repository.
Make sure to include a README.md file with instructions on how to use your action, including any required input parameters and expected output values.
Once your action is published, you can reference it in your workflows by using the uses keyword with the repository's URL:
```
jobs:
  My-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Run My JavaScript Action
          uses: your-username/my-js-action@main
           With:
          input1: 'example-value'
```
That's it! You have now successfully created a custom JavaScript-based GitHub Action.
By following these steps, you can develop and publish your own actions to automate various tasks and processes in your workflows.
Versioning and Publishing Your Custom ActionIn this section, we will discuss the best practices for versioning and publishing your custom GitHub Actions, ensuring that your action is easily accessible and manageable for users.
Semantic VersioningSemantic Versioning (SemVer) is a widely adopted versioning scheme that uses a simple format to convey information about changes in your action.
It uses a version number format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where:
MAJOR : Incremented when you introduce breaking changes or remove functionality.
MINOR : Incremented when you add new features that are backwards-compatible.
PATCH: Incremented when you fix bugs or make minor improvements that are backwards-compatible.

Adopting SemVer helps users understand the impact of updatesand makes it easier for them to choose the appropriate version of your action.
### Using Git Tags
Git tags are a convenient way to mark specific points in your re- pository's history as a release.
When you create a new release of your action, create a Git tag with the corresponding version number:
```
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
### Creating Release Branches
In addition to Git tags, you may want to create release branches for each major version of your action.
This allows you to maintain multiple versions concurrently, providing bug fixes and im- provements for older versions while continuing to develop new features.
For example, you can create a branch named v1 for the major version 1:
```
git checkout -b v1
git push -u origin v1
```

### Updating the README
In your action's README.md file, include clear instructions on how to reference different versions of your action in a workflow.
For instance:
To use the latest version of My Action, add the following step to your workflow:
```
steps:
  - name: Run My Action
    uses: your-username/my-action@main
```
To use a specific version of My Action, replace main with the desired version number:
```
steps:
  - name: Run My Action
    uses: your-username/my-action@v1.0.0
```
### Publishing Your Action
To make your action available for use in workflows, push the project to a GitHub repository.
Ensure that your README.md file contains comprehensive instructions on how to use your action, including any required input parameters and expected outputvalues.
Once your action is published, users can reference it in their workflows using the uses keyword with the repository's URL and the desired version:
```
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Run My Custom Action
           uses: your-username/my-action@v1
```
By following these best practices for versioning and publishing your custom GitHub Actions, you can provide a stable, reliable, and easy-to-use experience for your users, while maintaining flexibility for future improvements and updates.

### Code Coverage and Reporting
Code coverage is an important metric that measures the percent- age of your code that is executed during testing. It helps devel- opers identify areas of the code that may not be adequately tested and require additional tests to ensure correctness and reliability. In this section, we will discuss the significance of code coverage in the context of Continuous Integration and demonstrate how to configure GitHub Actions to generate code coverage reports as part of your CI pipeline.
### Introduction to Code Coverage
Code coverage is a metric that quantifies the degree to which the source code of a program is tested by a particular test suite. It is usually expressed as a percentage and represents the proportion of code lines, branches, functions, or other logical units that have been executed during the testing process. Code coverage provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of your test suite, highlighting areas of the code that may not be adequately tested and potentially harbouring undiscovered bugs or issues.

By measuring code coverage, developers can identify gaps in their test coverage and prioritize the creation of new tests to ensure that critical functionality is thoroughly tested.  It is important to note, however, that a high code coverage percentage does not guarantee the absence of bugs or the overall quality of the software.
It is merely an indicator of the extent to which the code has been exercised by the test suite.
Other factors, such as the thoroughness of the tests themselves, also play a crucial role in the reliability and maintainability of the codebase.
In the context of Continuous Integration, code coverage serves as a useful metric for monitoring the ongoing effectiveness of your test suite and guiding improvements to your testing strategy.

### Importance of Code Coverage in CI
Code coverage plays a crucial role in Continuous Integration (CI) for several reasons:
- [x] Early detection of untested code: By regularly measuring code coverage as part of your CI pipeline, you can quickly identify areas of the code that have not been sufficiently tested. This allows developers to address potential issues be- fore they become more significant problems and helps maintain a robust and reliable codebase.
- [x] Monitoring test suite effectiveness: Code coverage metrics provide insights into the overall effectiveness of your test suite, ensuring that it continues to provide adequate coverage as the codebase evolves. This enables developers to make informed decisions about where to focus their testing efforts, ensuring that the most critical parts of the code are thoroughly tested.
- [x] Improved code quality: A comprehensive test suite, combined with regular code coverage analysis, encourages developers to write cleaner, more modular code that is easier to test and maintain. This ultimately results in a higher-quality codebase with fewer bugs and issues.
- [x] Increased confidence in code changes: By maintaining a high level of code coverage, developers can have greater confidence that their changes will not introduce new bugs or regressions. This can lead to faster development cycles and improved collaboration between team members, as there is less risk associated with making changes to the code.
- [ ] Accountability and visibility: Integrating code coverage metrics into your CI pipeline provides a transparent and ob- jective measure of the test suite's effectiveness. This can help establish clear expectations and accountability for the team, ensuring that testing remains a priority throughout the development process.

In summary, code coverage is an essential aspect of implementing Continuous Integration, as it helps to ensure a high-quality, reliable codebase.
By regularly measuring and monitoring code coverage as part of your CI pipeline, you can identify gaps in your test coverage, prioritize testing efforts, and maintain a comprehensive test suite that minimizes the risk of bugs and regressions.

### Integrating Code Coverage Tools with GitHub Actions
Integrating a code coverage tool with GitHub Actions allows you to automate code coverage analysis as part of your CI/CD pipeline. In this section, we will discuss the general steps for integrating code coverage tools with GitHub Actions. Note that the specific steps may vary depending on the language, testing framework, and code coverage tool you are using.
- [x] Install the code coverage tool: First, ensure that the code coverage tool is installed and configured in your project. This may involve adding it as a dependency in your package manager (e.g., npm, pip, or Maven) or downloading and installing it manually.
- [x] Configure the testing framework: Next, configure your testing framework to generate code coverage data during test execution. This may involve modifying the test command or adding configuration options to your test runner. For example, if you are using Jest for JavaScript testing, you can add the --coverage flag to your Jest command.
- [x] Create a GitHub Actions workflow: If you don't already have one, create a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository by adding a .github/workflows directory and creating a YAML file within it (e.g., ci.yml). In this workflow file, define the steps required to install dependencies, build your project, and run tests.
- [x] Add code coverage analysis to the workflow: In your GitHub Actions workflow, add a step to run the code coverage analysis after your tests have been executed. Depending on the code coverage tool, this may involve running a separate command or adding a flag to your existing test command. For example, if you are using Istanbul for JavaScript code coverage, you might add the following step:

```
- name: Run code coverage analysis
run: npm run coverage
```

- [x] Configure coverage thresholds (optional): If desired, con- figure your code coverage tool to enforce minimum coverage thresholds, causing the CI pipeline to fail if coverage falls below the specified levels. This can help ensure that your test suite maintains a high level of coverage over time. Refer to your code coverage tool's documentation for instructions on setting up coverage thresholds.
- [x] Generate and publish coverage reports: Configure your code coverage tool to generate coverage reports in a for- mat compatible with GitHub Actions. Some code coverage tools have built-in support for publishing reports to GitHub or integrating with other reporting services like Codecov or Coveralls. Alternatively, you can use dedicated GitHub Ac- tions, such as actions/upload-artifact, to store the generated reports as workflow artifacts.
- [x] Visualize coverage data (optional): Optionally, you can use third-party services like Codecov or Coveralls to visualize your code coverage data, track coverage trends over time, and display coverage badges in your repository's README file.

By following these steps, you can integrate code coverage analysis into your GitHub Actions workflow, helping to ensure that your test suite remains effective and comprehensive as your codebase evolves.

### Configuring Code Coverage Thresholds
Code coverage thresholds are an effective way to ensure that your test suite maintains a high level of coverage over time. By set- ting minimum coverage requirements, you can enforce a certain standard of code quality and prevent untested code from being merged into your main branch. In this section, we will discuss the general process for configuring code coverage thresholds. Note that the specific steps may vary depending on the language, test- ing framework, and code coverage tool you are using.

- [x] Review your code coverage tool's documentation: Refer to the documentation for your specific code coverage tool to understand how to configure coverage thresholds. Most tools offer a way to specify minimum coverage levels, and some even allow you to set different thresholds for different cover- age metrics (e.g., line, branch, or function coverage).
- [x] Decide on appropriate threshold values: Determine the minimum coverage levels that you want to enforce for your project. These values should be realistic and achievable, while still promoting high code quality. Keep in mind that setting thresholds too high may be counterproductive, as it could discourage developers from writing tests and create a barrier to contribution.
- [x] Update your code coverage configuration: Add the threshold values to your code coverage tool's configuration file or settings. This may involve updating a JSON, YAML, or XML file, or modifying a command-line argument or environment variable. For example, if you are using Istanbul for JavaScript code coverage, you might add the following configuration to your package.json file:
```
"nyc": {
}
"check-coverage": true,
"branches": 80,
"functions": 80,
"lines": 80
"statements": 80
}
```
This configuration enforces a minimum of 80% coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements.
- [x] Integrate threshold enforcement into your CI/CD pipeline: Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline checks for coverage thresh- old compliance during the code coverage analysis step. If the thresholds are not met, the pipeline should fail, preventing the code changes from being merged. This can be accom- plished by modifying the coverage command or adding a separate step in your GitHub Actions workflow or other CI/ CD platform.
- [x] Monitor and adjust thresholds over time: As your project evolves, you may need to adjust your coverage thresholds to reflect changes in your codebase or testing strategy. Regu- larly review your coverage metrics and update your thresh- olds as necessary to maintain a high standard of code quality. By configuring code coverage thresholds and enforcing them as part of your CI/CD pipeline, you can promote a culture of thorough testing and help ensure that your codebase remains robust and re- liable over time.

#### Caching in GitHub Actions
Caching is a powerful technique that enables you to store and reuse the results of time-consuming tasks, such as dependency installation or build processes. By caching these results, you can avoid unnecessary work in subsequent runs, leading to faster workflow execution and reduced resource usage.
- [x] Cache dependencies: One of the most common uses of caching in GitHub Actions is to cache the dependencies of your project. By caching dependencies, you can save time and resources by not having to fetch and install them for every workflow run. GitHub Actions provides a built-in cache action that simplifies caching and restoring dependencies for various package managers, such as npm, yarn, or pip. To use the cache action, include it in your workflow and specify the path to the dependencies and a cache key. The cache key should include the relevant package configuration file's hash, ensuring that the cache is invalidated when dependen- cies change.
- [x] Cache build outputs: In addition to caching dependencies, you can also cache intermediate build outputs or compiled assets, such as binaries or compiled CSS and JavaScript files. This can significantly reduce build times in cases where the compilation process is time-consuming or resource-inten- sive.
To cache build outputs, use the cache action and specify the appropriate paths and cache key. Be mindful of the cache's size, as storing large build outputs can consume your GitHub Actions storage quota.
- [x] Cache Docker layers: If your workflows rely on Docker, caching Docker layers can help speed up the build process. By caching Docker layers, you can avoid rebuilding unchanged layers and reduce the time it takes to pull or push images.
To cache Docker layers, use GitHub's cache action in com- bination with Docker's buildx plugin. Alternatively, you can use a dedicated action, such as the satackey/action-docker- layer-caching action, which simplifies caching Docker layers in your GitHub Actions workflows.

### Artifact Management in GitHub Actions
Artifacts are files or collections of files produced by your work- flows, such as build outputs, test results, or documentation. Managing artifacts efficiently is crucial for optimizing your GitHub Actions workflows, as it allows you to share, store, and access these files across different jobs, workflows, or even repositories.
- [x] Upload and download artifacts: GitHub Actions provides built-in actions, upload-artifact and download-artifact, that enable you to upload and download artifacts within your workflows. These actions allow you to share files between jobs or store them for later use, such as deploying your appli- cation or distributing build assets. When using the upload-artifact action, specify the path to the files you want to upload and provide a name for the artifact. To download the artifact in another job, use the download- artifact action and specify the artifact's name.
- [x] Store artifacts for longer periods: By default, GitHub Actions stores artifacts for 90 days. However, you may need to store artifacts for longer periods, such as for compliance reasons or historical analysis. In these cases, consider using an external storage service, like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, to persist your artifacts. To store artifacts in an external storage service, use a dedicated action or script in your workflow to upload the artifacts to the desired storage location. Be sure to manage access control and permissions to ensure the security and privacy of your artifacts.
- [x] Optimize artifact storage: Efficiently managing artifact storage is essential for optimizing your GitHub Actions workflows and avoiding storage quota limitations. Here are some strategies to help you optimize artifact storage:
    - [x] Compress artifacts: Compressing your artifacts can sig- nificantly reduce their size and storage consumption. Use tools like gzip or zip to compress your files before uploading them as artifacts. Additionally, some file formats, such as images or text files, can benefit from specialized compression algorithms, like WebP for images or Brotli for text files.
    - [x] Delete unnecessary artifacts: Over time, your workflows may generate a large number of artifacts, some of which may no longer be needed. Periodically review and delete unnecessary artifacts to free up storage space. You can use the GitHub API or a GitHub Actions script to automate the process of identifying and deleting unneeded artifacts.
    - [x] Limit artifact retention: By default, GitHub Actions re- tains artifacts for 90 days. However, you can configure a cus- tom retention period to better suit your needs. For example, if you only need to keep artifacts for a short time, you can reduce the retention period to save storage space. Be cautious when setting a shorter retention period, as it may impact your ability to access and analyze historical artifacts.

In conclusion, effectively managing caches and artifacts is crucial for optimizing your GitHub Actions workflows. By employing caching strategies and efficient artifact management techniques, you can significantly reduce build times, resource consumption, and storage requirements, leading to a more efficient and cost-effective CI/CD pipeline.

#### Performance Optimization Tips
When working with GitHub Actions, optimizing the performance of your workflows is essential to ensuring a fast and efficient CI/ CD pipeline. A well-optimized pipeline reduces execution time, minimizes resource consumption, and allows you to get faster feedback on your code changes. In this section, we will explore various tips and best practices for optimizing the performance of your GitHub Actions workflows. We will cover aspects such as workflow structure, runner usage, parallelism, Docker image optimization, conditional execution, third-party action evaluation, and performance monitoring.
By implementing these optimization strategies, you can significantly improve the efficiency of your GitHub Actions workflows and ensure a smooth and cost-effective CI/CD process for your projects.

#### Optimize Workflow Structure
An efficient GitHub Actions workflow structure can significantly impact the overall performance of your CI/CD pipeline. By design- ing your workflows with performance in mind, you can reduce execution time and resource consumption. Here are some tips for optimizing your workflow structure:

- [x] Organize jobs efficiently: Divide your workflow into smaller, focused jobs that can be executed in parallel or se- quentially, depending on their dependencies. By organizing your jobs efficiently, you can minimize idle time and make the most of GitHub Actions' parallel execution capabilities. Ensure that independent tasks run concurrently, while de- pendent tasks are arranged sequentially.
- [x] Minimize job dependencies: While some jobs may depend on the output of other jobs, minimizing job dependencies can help reduce overall execution time. By minimizing dependencies, you allow for greater parallelism, which can lead to faster completion of your workflows.
- [x] Reuse common steps: If your workflows contain common steps, such as setting up the environment or installing dependencies, consider consolidating these steps into reusable components, such as composite actions or shared shell scripts. Reusing common steps can help you maintain a clean and efficient workflow structure and reduce duplication of code across workflows.
- [x] Split workflows by event or branch: Instead of having a single workflow that handles multiple events or branches, consider splitting your workflows based on the triggering event or target branch. This approach allows you to tailor each workflow to its specific purpose, making it easier to optimize and maintain. For example, you can have separate workflows for pull requests, pushes to the main branch, and scheduled events.
- [x] Optimize matrix builds: Matrix builds enable you to run a job across multiple combinations of operating systems, runtime versions, or other configurations. While matrix builds can be incredibly powerful, they can also consume a significant amount of resources if not managed carefully. To optimize matrix builds, limit the number of combinations you test, and focus on the most important or relevant config- urations for your project. You can also leverage the exclude or include options to fine-tune your matrix configuration.
- [ ] Prioritize critical tasks: Arrange your workflow in a way that prioritizes critical tasks, such as building and testing your application. By ensuring that these tasks are executed first, you can quickly identify any issues and fail the workflow early, avoiding unnecessary work and resource consumption.
- [x] Use artifacts effectively: Artifacts allow you to share data between jobs or store build outputs for later use. By effect- ively using artifacts, you can avoid duplicating work across jobs and improve the overall efficiency of your workflow. Be mindful of the size and number of artifacts you generate, as storing large or numerous artifacts can impact your storage quotas.

By optimizing your workflow structure, you can significantly en- hance the performance and efficiency of your GitHub Actions CI/ CD pipeline. A well-designed workflow structure not only reduces execution time and resource consumption but also improves maintainability and readability, making it easier for you and your team to collaborate on your projects.


### Minimize Use of GitHub-hosted Runners
GitHub-hosted runners are a convenient option for running your workflows, as they provide a pre-configured environment with various tools and support for multiple operating systems. How- ever, using GitHub-hosted runners can have some drawbacks, in- cluding limited resources, potential queue times, and cost implications, especially for large-scale projects or organizations.
Here are some strategies to minimize the use of GitHub-hosted runners and optimize your workflow performance:
- [x] Use self-hosted runners: By setting up self-hosted runners, you gain more control over the environment, hardware, and resources available for your workflows. Self-hosted runners can be customized to your project's specific needs and can help reduce queue times, especially if your organization has many concurrent workflows. Additionally, using self-hosted runners can be more cost-effective in the long run, particu- larly for large-scale or resource-intensive projects.
- [x] Optimize resource usage: Make the most of the resources available on GitHub-hosted runners by optimizing your workflows to use fewer resources. This can include reducing the number of parallel jobs, limiting matrix build configurations, and optimizing build and test processes. By using resources more efficiently, you can reduce the chances of hitting resource limits or experiencing performance bottle- necks.
- [x] Cache dependencies: Caching dependencies can significantly reduce the time spent on installing and setting up your environment in each job. By leveraging GitHub Actions' built-in caching mechanisms, you can minimize the need for network transfers and reduce the load on GitHub-hosted runners.
- [x] Schedule non-critical workflows: If you have non-critical workflows, such as nightly builds or scheduled maintenance tasks, consider running them during off-peak hours to reduce the load on GitHub-hosted runners. This can help alleviate queue times and ensure that critical workflows, such as those triggered by pull requests or pushes, have faster access to runners.
- [x] Limit workflow concurrency: Use the concurrency keyword to limit the number of concurrent runs for a specific work- flow or job. By limiting concurrency, you can prevent excessive resource usage on GitHub-hosted runners and ensure that resources are available for other critical workflows. - [x] Optimize build times: Invest time in optimizing your build and test processes to reduce the overall execution time of your workflows. Faster builds and tests not only save time but also reduce resource consumption on GitHub-hosted runners.

By minimizing the use of GitHub-hosted runners and implementing these optimization strategies, you can improve the performance of your GitHub Actions workflows, reduce resource consumption, and manage costs more effectively. These optimizations can be particularly valuable for large-scale projects or organ- izations where resource demands and costs can quickly add up.

### Limit Parallelism and Concurrency
While parallelism and concurrency can significantly improve the performance of your GitHub Actions workflows, it's essential to strike a balance between maximizing speed and minimizing re- source consumption. Overloading your workflows with too many parallel jobs or concurrent runs can lead to increased queue times, resource contention, and higher costs.

Here are some strategies for limiting parallelism and concurrency in your workflows:
- [x] Limit matrix build configurations: While matrix builds can simplify your workflow configuration, they can also quickly multiply the number of parallel jobs. Limit the number of matrix configurations by focusing on the most critical com- binations of platforms, languages, and dependencies. Add- itionally, use the exclude keyword to remove unnecessary combinations that do not add significant value to your CI/CD pipeline.
- [x] Use job dependencies: Organize your workflow into a logical sequence of jobs with dependencies, using the needs keyword. By defining job dependencies, you can ensure that only the required jobs are executed in parallel, limiting re- source consumption while maintaining a streamlined CI/CD pipeline.
- [x] Limit job concurrency: Use the concurrency keyword to limit the number of concurrent runs for a specific job. This can help prevent resource contention and ensure that resources are available for other critical jobs in your workflow.
- [ ] Evaluate parallel test execution: Parallelizing tests can speed up your workflow, but it can also lead to increased resource consumption. Analyze your test suite to determine if parallel execution is necessary and beneficial. If pos- sible, consider optimizing your tests or organizing them into smaller, more focused test suites that can run faster with less parallelism.
- [x] Optimize parallel job configuration: Carefully review your workflow configuration to identify opportunities to op- timize parallel jobs. Ensure that each parallel job provides meaningful value, and avoid running redundant or unneces- sary jobs in parallel.
- [x] Monitor resource usage: Continuously monitor the resource usage of your GitHub Actions workflows. Use the built-in performance metrics and monitoring tools provided by GitHub to identify performance bottlenecks, resource conten- tion, and opportunities for optimization.

By limiting parallelism and concurrency in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can effectively manage resource consumption, reduce queue times, and control costs while maintaining a fast and efficient CI/CD pipeline. Finding the right balance between paral- lelism and resource usage is key to optimizing your workflows for both performance and cost.

### Optimize Docker Image Usage
Docker images play a significant role in the performance and re- source consumption of your GitHub Actions workflows. Efficient use and management of Docker images can help reduce the time it takes to set up and run your workflows, minimize resource usage, and ultimately save costs. Here are some strategies to optimize Docker image usage in your GitHub Actions workflows:
- [x] Use lightweight base images: When creating custom Docker images for your workflows or building your applica- tions, always use lightweight base images to minimize the size and resource overhead. Popular lightweight base images include Alpine Linux and other minimal distributions that contain only the essential components needed to run your applications.
- [x] Cache Docker images: Leverage GitHub Actions' built-in caching mechanisms to cache Docker images and layers be- tween workflow runs. By caching Docker images, you can re- duce the time spent downloading images and minimize the network overhead, leading to faster workflow execution and lower resource usage.
- [x] Optimize Docker layers: When building your custom Docker images, structure your Dockerfile to optimize the layering of your images. Group related commands and files in each layer to minimize the number of layers and reduce the overall image size. Additionally, place frequently chan- ging layers towards the bottom of your Dockerfile to improve caching efficiency.
- [x] Remove unnecessary files and packages: Keep your Docker images lean and focused by only including the necessary files and packages required to run your application or workflow. Remove any extraneous files, dependencies, or tools that are not needed, as these can significantly increase the image size and resource usage.
- [x] Use multi-stage builds: Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile, enabling you to create smaller, more optimized images. By using multi- stage builds, you can separate the build process from the run- time environment, only including the required artifacts and dependencies in your final image.
- [x] Regularly update and maintain images: Continuously review and update your Docker images to ensure they are up to date with the latest security patches, performance improvements, and dependency updates. Regularly maintain- ing your images helps you avoid potential security risks and ensures optimal performance.

By optimizing Docker image usage in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can significantly improve the performance and re- source efficiency of your CI/CD pipeline. Implementing these best practices can help you reduce the time spent setting up and running your workflows, minimize resource consumption, and man- age costs more effectively.

### Leverage Conditional Execution
Conditional execution is a powerful feature of GitHub Actions that enables you to control when specific jobs or steps should run based on various conditions. By leveraging conditional execution, you can optimize your workflows' performance and resource usage by only running the necessary jobs or steps based on the current context, such as the event type, branch, or even the changes made in a pull request.
Here are some strategies for using conditional execution to opti- mize your GitHub Actions workflows:

- [x] Filter by event type or branch: Use the if keyword in your workflow configuration to define conditions based on the event type or branch. For example, you can run specific jobs or steps only when a pull request is merged or when a push event occurs in a specific branch. This helps you avoid running unnecessary jobs or steps in certain scenarios, sav- ing time and resources.
- [x] Skip jobs or steps based on changes: Utilize the paths and paths-ignore keywords to define conditions based on the changes made in a pull request or push event. This allows you to skip jobs or steps when specific files or directories are not affected by the changes, resulting in faster workflow execu- tion and reduced resource consumption.
- [x] Use context and expressions: Leverage the rich set of context and expressions provided by GitHub Actions to create com- plex conditions based on the runtime environment, previous job results, or other dynamic factors. This enables you to tailor your workflow execution to the specific needs of each run, optimizing performance and resource usage.
- [x] Combine conditions with logical operators: Use logical operators such as && (and), || (or), and ! (not) to com- bine multiple conditions and create more sophisticated rules for conditional execution. This allows you to fine-tune your workflow configuration and ensure that jobs or steps are exe- cuted only when all the necessary conditions are met.
- [x] Error handling and continue-on-error: Utilize the continue- on-error keyword to control the behaviour of your workflow when a step fails. This can help you avoid unnecessary resource consumption by stopping the execution of subsequent steps or jobs when a critical failure occurs.

By leveraging conditional execution in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can significantly improve the performance and resource efficiency of your CI/CD pipeline. Implementing these best practices can help you reduce the time spent running your work- flows, minimize resource consumption, and manage costs more effectively while maintaining a fast and efficient CI/CD process.

### Evaluate and Optimize Third-Party Actions
Third-party actions from the GitHub Actions Marketplace can significantly enhance your workflows by providing pre-built solutions for common tasks and integrations with various services. However, using third-party actions can also impact the performance and resource usage of your workflows. To optimize the use of third-party actions in your GitHub Actions workflows, follow these strategies:
- [x] Review and evaluate actions: Before adding a third-party action to your workflow, carefully review and evaluate its documentation, source code, and user feedback. Ensure that the action is well-maintained, secure, and efficient. Avoid using actions that have known performance issues, security vulnerabilities or are no longer actively maintained.
- [x] Limit the number of actions: While it can be tempting to use multiple actions for various tasks, it's essential to limit the number of actions in your workflows to those that are truly necessary. Each action adds overhead to your workflow execution and can increase the time it takes to run your jobs. Evaluate if a specific action is required or if the same functionality can be achieved using built-in GitHub Actions fea- tures or simple shell commands.
- [x] Optimize action inputs and configuration: When using third-party actions, ensure that you provide the correct in- puts and configuration settings to optimize their perform- ance. Some actions may offer optional parameters or settings that can help you fine-tune their behaviour and resource usage. Refer to the action's documentation for details on available options and best practices.
- [x] Cache action dependencies: Some third-party actions may require external dependencies, such as Node.js packages, to function. Use GitHub Actions' built-in caching mechanisms to cache these dependencies between workflow runs, reducing the time spent downloading and installing them, and minimizing network overhead.
- [x] Monitor and analyze action performance: Regularly monitor the performance of the third-party actions you use in your workflows. Analyze the time spent executing each action and identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. If you discover an action that consistently underperforms
or consumes excessive resources, consider replacing it with a more efficient alternative or implementing the required functionality using custom scripts or built-in features.

By carefully evaluating and optimizing the use of third-party actions in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can improve the performance and resource efficiency of your CI/CD pipeline. Fol- lowing these best practices will help you reduce the time spent running your workflows, minimize resource consumption, and manage costs more effectively, while still benefiting from the extensive ecosystem of GitHub Actions.

### Monitor and Analyze Workflow Performance
Monitoring and analyzing the performance of your GitHub Actions workflows is crucial to identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization. Continuous monitoring helps you maintain a fast and efficient CI/CD pipeline, minimize resource consumption, and manage costs more effectively. Here are some strategies to monitor and analyze the performance of your GitHub Actions workflows:

- [x] Leverage GitHub's built-in analytics: Use the built-in analytics features provided by GitHub to monitor the per- formance of your workflows, such as average run duration, success rate, and queue time. Analyze these metrics to identify trends and potential issues, and use the information to guide your optimization efforts.
- [x] Inspect individual workflow runs: Examine the logs and execution details of individual workflow runs to gain insights into the performance of specific jobs and steps. This can help you identify slow or resource-intensive tasks that may require optimization or refactoring.
- [x] Monitor resource usage: Keep track of the resource usage of your GitHub-hosted runners, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to ensure that your workflows are running efficiently and not exhausting available resources. If you notice con- sistent resource constraints, consider optimizing your work- flows or using self-hosted runners with more resources.
- [x] Use third-party monitoring tools: Integrate your GitHub Actions workflows with external monitoring and observability tools, such as Datadog or Grafana, to gain deeper insights into your CI/CD pipeline's performance. These tools can help you visualize and analyze workflow metrics, set up alerts, and identify trends over time.
- [x] Establish performance baselines and goals: Define performance baselines and goals for your workflows, such as target run duration, success rate, and resource consumption. Regularly review your workflows' performance against these benchmarks and take corrective action when necessary to ensure that your CI/CD pipeline remains fast and efficient.
- [ ] Continuously optimize: Continuously review and optimize your workflows to address any performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies. Use the insights gathered from monitoring and analysis to guide your optimization efforts, such as refactoring slow steps, using more efficient actions, or imple-
menting conditional execution.

By actively monitoring and analyzing the performance of your GitHub Actions workflows, you can ensure that your CI/CD pipeline remains fast, efficient, and cost-effective. Implementing these best practices will help you identify and address potential issues before they become critical, improving the overall reliability and effectiveness of your CI/CD process.

In conclusion, Chapter 9 has provided you with valuable insights and best practices for securing and optimizing your GitHub Actions workflows. Ensuring the security of your workflows is paramount, as it prevents unauthorized access, protects sensitive information, and maintains the integrity of your CI/CD pipeline. Optimization, on the other hand, helps you create efficient and cost-effective workflows that make the best use of available re- sources and minimize execution time.

By following the guidelines and recommendations outlined in this chapter, you can create a secure and efficient CI/CD pipeline that enhances your development process and improves the overall quality of your software projects.

In this chapter, we will cover a variety of advanced topics, such as using dynamic matrix builds, working with advanced shell scripting, integrating with other CI/CD platforms, and exploring the GitHub API for customized actions. By mastering these advanced techniques, you'll be able to tackle complex automation scenarios and unlock the full potential of GitHub Actions to streamline your software development process.
Whether you're looking to optimize your existing workflows or tackle new challenges with GitHub Actions, this chapter provides the knowledge and tools you need to elevate your CI/CD pipeline to the next level. So let's dive in and explore the advanced techniques that will help you get the most out of GitHub Actions.
#### Workflow Templates and Reusable Workflows
As your organization grows and you manage multiple repositories, it becomes increasingly important to standardize and maintain consistency across your GitHub Actions workflows. Workflow templates and reusable workflows help streamline your CI/CD pipeline management and reduce duplication of code, making it easier to maintain and update your workflows across multiple re- positories. In this section, we'll explore these two powerful fea- tures and demonstrate how to use them effectively.

#### Workflow Templates
Workflow templates can significantly streamline the process of creating and maintaining GitHub Actions workflows within your organization. They provide a predefined structure that allows you to create reusable workflow files that can be easily shared across multiple repositories. Workflow templates are particularly useful for organizations with multiple repositories sharing similar CI/ CD pipelines or automation tasks, as they enable consistency and maintainability across projects.

To create a workflow template, follow these steps:

- [x] Create a .github repository: Start by creating a new reposi- tory named .github within your organization. This reposi- tory will store your organization's workflow templates and other shared resources.
- [x] Create a workflow-templates directory: Inside the .github re- pository, create a new directory called workflow-templates.
- [ ] Create a template file: In the workflow-templates directory, create a new workflow file with a yaml extension. This file will contain the template for your reusable workflow. Define the workflow as you would for a regular GitHub Actions workflow, including triggers, jobs, steps, and actions. How- ever, remember that this file should be generic enough to be used across multiple repositories.
- [x] Add a template metadata file: Create a JSON metadata file for your template with the same name as your work- flow template file, but with a properties.json extension. This file should be placed in the workflow-templates directory. The metadata file contains information about your template, such as its name, description, and any required inputs. Here's an example of a metadata file:
```
{
"name": "My Workflow Template",
"description": "A reusable workflow template for building and testing code",
"iconName": "example-icon",
"categories":["CI", "Build"],
"inputs": {
    "buildConfiguration": {
             "description": "The build configuration to use",
             "default": "Release",
             "required": false
    }
  }
}
```

- [x] Commit and push your changes: Commit and push the changes to your .github repository. The new workflow template will now be available for use in your organization's repositories.

To use a workflow template in a repository, follow these steps:
- [x] Navigate to the repository's Actions tab: Go to the GitHub Actions tab of the repository where you want to use the workflow template.
- [x] Select the template: Click on the "New workflow" button, and you'll see a list of available workflow templates. Find the template you want to use and click on the "Set up this workflow" button.
- [x] Customize the workflow: The template's content will be copied into a new workflow file in your repository. Customize the workflow as needed, such as by providing any required input values or making project-specific adjustments.
- [x] Commit the new workflow: Save your changes and commit the new workflow file to your repository. The workflow will now run based on the configuration defined in the template.

By using workflow templates, you can save time and effort by reusing predefined workflows across your organization's repositories. They promote consistency, maintainability, and best practices, enabling you to create more efficient and effective GitHub Actions workflows.

### Reusable Workflows
Reusable workflows are another powerful feature in GitHub Ac- tions that allows you to reuse entire workflows or parts of workflows within a single repository or across multiple repositories.
By creating reusable workflows, you can reduce duplication, maintain consistency, and ensure that best practices are followed across your organization.
Unlike workflow templates, which require you to copy the tem- plate content into a new workflow file, reusable workflows are dir- ectly referenced from another workflow using the uses keyword. This means that any updates to the reusable workflow will be automatically applied to all workflows that reference it.
To create a reusable workflow, follow these steps:

- [x] Define the reusable workflow: In your repository, cre- ate a new GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., reusable-work- flow.yml) or use an existing one. Define the workflow as usual, specifying triggers, jobs, and steps. If you want to make this workflow reusable, you can add the workflow_call trigger to the on section:
```
on:
  workflow_call:
      inputs:
        input_name:
            description: 'Input description' required: true
            type: 'string'
```

This example defines an input called input_name. When another workflow references this reusable workflow, it must provide a value for this input.

- [x] Commit and push your changes: Commit and push the changes to your repository. The new reusable workflow will now be available for use in your own repository or other repositories.

To use a reusable workflow in another workflow, follow these steps:

- [x] Create or edit a workflow file: In your repository, create a new workflow file (e.g., main.yml ) or edit an existing one.
- [ ] Reference the reusable workflow: In the workflow file, add a new job that references the reusable workflow using the uses keyword. Provide any required input values using the with keyword:
```
jobs: my_job:
uses: organization/repository/.github/workflows/reusable-work- flow.yml@branch
with:
input_name: 'My Input Value'
```
Replace organization, repository, and branch with the appropriate values for your scenario. The job will now execute the steps defined in the reusable workflow.

- [ ] Commit and push your changes: Commit and push the changes to your repository. The workflow will now run using the reusable workflow's configuration.

By using reusable workflows, you can efficiently share workflows and their components across repositories, ensuring that updates and improvements are automatically propagated. This approach promotes consistency, maintainability, and best practices, allow- ing you to build more effective and efficient GitHub Actions workflows.

### Handling Workflow Dependencies
In complex projects, it's common to have multiple workflows with dependencies on each other. Properly managing these dependencies is crucial to ensure the efficient and accurate execution of your GitHub Actions workflows. This section will provide an overview of how to identify and handle workflow dependencies, including managing inter-workflow dependencies, sequential and dynamic job execution, cross-repository workflow dependencies, and handling failures and errors in dependent workflows. By understanding these concepts, you will be able to design more ro- bust and maintainable GitHub Actions workflows that address the challenges of complex dependencies in your projects.
#### Identifying Workflow Dependencies
Before you can effectively manage workflow dependencies, it's essential to identify the relationships between your workflows. Workflow dependencies can exist at different levels and in different forms. They may include dependencies between jobs within the same workflow, between workflows within the same repository, or even between workflows across multiple repositories. Identifying these dependencies is the first step toward managing them effectively.
Here are some steps to help you identify workflow dependencies:

- [x] Analyze your project's structure and requirements: Start by reviewing your project's structure and understanding its requirements. Determine which tasks need to be executed in a particular order, which tasks can be executed in parallel, and which tasks are independent of each other.
- [x] Review your existing workflows: Examine your existing GitHub Actions workflows to identify any implicit or ex- plicit dependencies between jobs and workflows. Look for instances where one job or workflow depends on the completion, success, or failure of another job or workflow. These dependencies may be indicated by the use of specific triggers, artifacts, or outputs.
- [x] Map out dependencies: Create a visual representation of the dependencies between your workflows and jobs, such as a flowchart or dependency graph. This will help you gain a clear understanding of the relationships between workflows and identify any potential bottlenecks or issues in your current setup.
- [x] Consider external dependencies: Don't forget to account for external dependencies, such as third-party services, APIs, or other resources that your workflows depend on. These de- pendencies can also affect the execution of your workflows and need to be managed accordingly.

By carefully identifying workflow dependencies, you can design more efficient and robust workflows that account for the various relationships between jobs and workflows. This understanding will serve as a foundation for managing inter-workflow dependencies, sequential and dynamic job execution, cross-repository workflow dependencies, and handling failures and errors in dependent workflows.


### Managing Inter-Workflow Dependencies
Once you have identified the dependencies between your workflows, the next step is to manage these inter-workflow dependencies effectively. Managing inter-workflow dependencies involves coordinating the execution of different workflows, ensuring that dependent workflows are triggered at the appropriate time, and handling the exchange of information between workflows.

Here are some strategies to help you manage inter-workflow dependencies:
- [x] Use triggers and events: Leverage GitHub Actions triggers and events to coordinate the execution of dependent work- flows. For instance, you can use the workflow_run event to trigger a workflow when another workflow completes. By specifying the appropriate workflow_id or workflow name and the branch that the triggering workflow should run on, you can ensure that dependent workflows are executed in the correct order.
- [x] Use workflow artifacts: Share data between workflows by using artifacts. Artifacts can store files, such as build outputs or intermediate results, which can be consumed by down- stream workflows. Upload artifacts in the producing work- flow using the actions/upload-artifact action, and download them in the consuming workflow using the actions/download- artifact action.
- [x] Leverage outputs: Use workflow outputs to pass information between workflows. In the producing workflow, define outputs using the outputs key- word and set their values using the echo "::set-output name=<output_name>::<output_value>" command. In the con- suming workflow, access the outputs using the needs key- word followed by the job id and the output name, for ex- ample, ${{ needs.<job_id>.outputs.<output_name> }} .
- [x] Handle failures: Manage the behaviour of dependent work- flows in case of failures. You can use the if keyword in com- bination with the needs keyword to control the execution of jobs based on the success or failure of their dependencies. Additionally, you can use the continue-on-error keyword to specify whether a job should continue executing even if one of its steps encounters an error.
- [x] Optimize workflow execution: Balance the execution of dependent workflows to optimize resource usage and minimize execution time. Use parallelization, job-level conditions, and other performance optimization techniques to ensure that workflows are executed efficiently and only when necessary.

By employing these strategies, you can effectively manage inter-workflow dependencies in your GitHub Actions setup. This will help you create more robust, maintainable, and efficient workflows that can handle the complexities of your project's requirements.
### Sequential Job Execution
In some scenarios, you may need to enforce the execution of jobs within a workflow in a specific order. Sequential job execution ensures that one job starts only after the previous job has completed successfully. This can be particularly useful when the output of one job is required as input for another or when job execution order is essential for the correct functioning of the application.

Here's how you can implement sequential job execution in your GitHub Actions workflows:

- [x] Use the needs keyword: The needs keyword allows you to define dependencies between jobs within a workflow. By specifying the job(s) that another job depends on, you can ensure that the dependent job runs only after the required job(s) have completed successfully. For example:
```
jobs:
job1:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps:
- name: Execute task 1
run:...
job2:
needs: job1
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Execute task 2
run: ...
```
In this example, job2 depends on job1, so job2 will only start executing after job1 has successfully completed.


Chain multiple jobs: For more complex workflows that involve multiple sequential jobs, simply chain the jobs using the needs keyword. This creates a linear execution order in which each job starts only after its predecessor has completed successfully:
```
jobs: job1:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Execute task 1
run: ...

2.
job2:
needs: job1
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Execute task 2
run: ...

job3:
needs: job2
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Execute task 3
run: ...
```
In this example, job3 depends on job2, which in turn depends on job1. As a result, the jobs will execute in the order job1 -> job2 -> job3.

By using the needs keyword to define job dependencies and enforce sequential job execution, you can effectively manage the order of job execution within your workflows. This helps ensure that your workflows run correctly and efficiently, adhering to the specific requirements of your project.

#### Dynamic Job Execution
In some cases, you might want to have more control over the execution of jobs within your workflow based on dynamic conditions, such as the output of a previous job or the result of a script. Dynamic job execution enables you to run jobs only when certain conditions are met, adding flexibility and adaptability to your workflows.
To implement dynamic job execution in your GitHub Actions workflows, you can utilize the following strategies:

- [x] Use job outputs: Job outputs allow you to store and pass data between jobs in a workflow. By using the output of a previous job as input for another job, you can control job execution based on the outcome of the earlier job. For example:
```
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
       - name: Execute task 1
         id: task1
        run: echo "::set-output name=result::success"
outputs:
       result: ${{ steps.task1.outputs.result}}
job2:
  needs: job1
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
if: ${{ needs.job1.outputs.result == 'success' }}
  steps:
    - name: Execute task 2
      run: ...
```

In this example, job2 depends on job1, and job2 will only start executing if the output result from job1 is set to 'success'.

- [x] Leverage conditional execution: You can use the if keyword to execute jobs based on dynamic conditions. By combining this with job outputs, environment variables, or context data, you can create complex execution scenarios that better suit your project requirements:
```
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Execute task 1
run: ...
job2:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
run: echo "::set-output name=result::success"
if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
steps:
- name: Execute task 2
run: ...
```
In this example, job2 will only execute if the event that trig- gered the workflow is a push to the 'main' branch.

Dynamic job execution provides the flexibility to adapt your work- flows to various scenarios, improving their efficiency and effectiveness. By using job outputs and conditional execution, you can create dynamic workflows that are better suited to the unique requirements of your project.

#### Cross-Repository Workflow Dependencies
In some cases, you may have multiple repositories with workflows that depend on one another. Managing dependencies across repositories can be challenging, but GitHub Actions provides you with tools and techniques to efficiently handle cross-repository workflow dependencies.
To manage cross-repository workflow dependencies, you can use the following approaches:

- [x] Repository Dispatch Events: You can use the Repository Dispatch Event to trigger a workflow in another repository by sending a webhook event. This method allows you to trigger workflows in different repositories based on the outcome or events in the source repository.

To set up a Repository Dispatch Event, follow these steps:

- [x] Create a workflow in the target repository that listens for the repository_dispatch event:
```
name: Target Repository Workflow
on:
repository_dispatch:
types: [custom_event]
jobs:
handle_dispatch:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Execute task
run: ...
```

- [x] In the source repository, use a curl command in your workflow to send the webhook event to the target repository:

```
steps:
- name: Trigger target repository workflow
run: |
curl -XPOST \
-H "Authorization: token ${{ secrets.TARGET_REPO_TOKEN }}" \ -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \ "https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/TARGET_REPO/dispatches"\
-d '{"event_type": "custom_event"}"
```

Make sure to replace OWNER, TARGET_REPO, and TAR- GET_REPO_TOKEN with the appropriate values. The TARGET_REPO_TOKEN should be a personal access token or a GitHub App installation token with the repo scope and stored as a secret in the source repository.

Using the workflow_run event: This event allows you to trigger a workflow in the same repository based on the completion of another workflow. Although it does not directly support cross-repository dependencies, you can use it in combination with the Repository Dispatch Event to man- age dependencies across repositories.

First, set up a workflow run event in your source repository to trigger a Repository Dispatch Event when the workflow completes:
```
name: Source Repository Workflow
on:
workflow_run:
workflows: ["Another Workflow"]
types:
jobs:
- completed
trigger_target_repo:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Trigger target repository workflow
run: ...
# Add the curl command from the previous example to
# send the webhook event
```

By leveraging these techniques, you can manage cross-repository workflow dependencies and ensure that your workflows are exe- cuted in the desired sequence across different repositories.

### Handling Failures and Errors in Dependent Workflows
When working with dependent workflows, it's crucial to handle failures and errors gracefully to maintain the stability and reliabil- ity of your CI/CD pipeline. By effectively managing errors, you can prevent a single failure from causing cascading issues across your entire system.
In this section, we will discuss various strategies for handling fail- ures and errors in dependent workflows:

- [x] Using if conditions: You can use conditional statements in your workflow to determine if a job or step should execute based on the outcome of a previous job or step. For example, you can use the needs keyword to specify job dependencies and then use an if condition to check the status of the required job:
```
jobs:
job1:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
- name: Execute task
run: ...
job2:
needs: job1
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
if: success()
steps:
- name: Execute task
run:...
```

In this example, job2 will only execute if job1 is successful.

- [x] Implementing retries: In some cases, transient errors can cause a job or step to fail. To handle these situations, you can implement retries to give your workflow additional chances to succeed. You can use the retry keyword in combination with a custom action or a third-party action like action-retry to retry a step or job:
```
steps:
- name: Execute task with retries
uses: nick-invision/retry@v2
with:
max_attempts: 3
delay_seconds: 10
command: your-command-here
```

- [x] Error handling with continue-on-error: To prevent a single failing step from causing the entire job to fail, you can use the continue-on-error keyword to allow the workflow to continue even if a specific step encounters an error:

```
steps:
- name: Execute task
run: ...
continue-on-error: true
```

- [x] Notifications and monitoring: Keep track of workflow failures and errors by setting up notifications and monitoring. You can use built-in GitHub features, like email notifications, or integrate third-party tools and services, like Slack or PagerDuty, to receive alerts when your workflows encounter issues.

By incorporating these error-handling techniques into your dependent workflows, you can create more robust and resilient CI/ CD pipelines that can gracefully handle failures and maintain the overall health of your projects.

In conclusion, handling workflow dependencies effectively is essential for maintaining a reliable and efficient CI/CD pipeline. By identifying and managing inter-workflow dependencies, implementing sequential and dynamic job execution, and handling cross-repository dependencies, you can create a more robust and streamlined pipeline. Additionally, addressing failures and errors using conditional statements, retries, error handling with continue-on-error, and proper notifications and monitoring will help ensure your pipeline remains resilient in the face of issues. As you continue to refine your GitHub Actions workflows, keep these techniques and best practices in mind to optimize your depend- ency management and improve the overall performance of your development process.
