- [x] Sua equipe frequentemente cria novos repositórios e quer padronizar o processo de CI/CD. Qual é a maneira mais eficaz de conseguir isso com o GitHub Actions? `Utilize modelos de fluxo de trabalho armazenados em um repositório .github designado e faça referência a eles em novos repositórios.`
- [x] Sua equipe desenvolveu uma GitHub Action que contém lógica de negócios sensível específica para os processos internos da sua organização. Você quer garantir que essa ação não seja acessível fora da sua organização. Qual modelo de distribuição você deve selecionar para essa ação? `Armazene a ação em um repositório privado dentro da sua organização e gerencie o acesso por meio de permissões de repositório.`
- [x] Sua equipe gerencia seus próprios custos de infraestrutura usando um modelo de chargeback e quer garantir que os fluxos de trabalho de desenvolvimento não utilizem os runners pagos por sua equipe. Qual recurso do GitHub Actions pode ajudar a atingir esse objetivo? `runner groups`
- [x] Sua equipe precisa executar uma série de comandos shell como parte do seu pipeline de CI/CD para configurar o ambiente antes de implantar seu aplicativo. Que tipo de ação você deve usar no seu fluxo de trabalho do GitHub Actions para realizar essa tarefa? `Uma etapa de execução que executa diretamente os comandos shell no ambiente do executor.`
- [x] Sua equipe quer padronizar processos de CI/CD em vários projetos. Como os modelos de fluxo de trabalho e ação podem ser reutilizados de forma eficaz? `Use um repositório .github centralizado para armazenar modelos de fluxo de trabalho e referenciá-los em repositórios de projetos individuais.`
